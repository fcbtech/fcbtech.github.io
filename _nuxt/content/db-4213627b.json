But whether or not a business can survive with or without one is debatable. As your business grows, there's a need for automation in business processes, even more so as a lean team. In your position, many companies think of implementing [ERP solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) to their businesses. The objective of implementing an ERP system is smoothly integrating data and processes across an organization. Still, many companies end up running into failure during the implementation. In fact, it is believed that as many as [29% of all ERP implementations end up failing](https://learn.g2.com/erp-statistics).\n\n<blog-image alt=\"3 Challenges SMEs Face In Implementing ERP Solutions\" image=\"failure-factors-of-ERP-implementation-300x169-1.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\nSo here are the top 3 challenges that SMEs face in ERP implementation. By the end of this article, you should be able to decide for yourself if ERP is something your business needs or not.\n\n#### 1\\. Managing Complexity\n\nAs a new ERP system is no small investment getting it right should be the number one priority. Most SMEs don't have the human resource to handle an ERP implementation. In fact, it is not uncommon for small companies not to have an internal IT department. This means a lack of valuable IT knowledge. This can all lead to stress and confusion.\n\nHow can you get it right? Probably the best solution would be to hire external ERP consultants who will not only implement the solution but will also be part of the planning (pre-implementation) and training of users (post-implementation). But EP consultants are expensive, almost 60% of the implementation cost. Implementation cost is anyway way more than most SMEs can afford. Still, there's no guarantee that the implementation will be successful. Also, there have been instances where after the upfront payment the vendors aren't as supportive at the time of implementing ERP solutions, leaving business owners helpless and nowhere to go.\n\nSo maybe what SMEs need is not an ERP. Just an easy to use and affordable integrated solution for your business that provides amazing customer support. Which is exactly what [TranZact](/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=3%20Challenges%20SMEs%20Face%20In%20Implementing%20ERP%20Solutions) brings to you and your business.

Getting Your Team Onboarded\n\nHere are the top reasons why your employees don’t want to use ERP. There’s also no doubt that most Indian SMEs are unstructured with employees who are uncomfortable with the idea of digitization. Making them comfortable with using complicated ERPs can take a lot of training time. Employees’ confidence with an ERP solution is quick to waver when training on the system is rushed. SMEs usually have a limited number of employees and they can’t afford to train their employees during work hours thus, no training really happens and employees end up having no confidence in the system.\n\nAlso, employee drive often relies heavily on the example set by company management. If the management is also not sure about the implementation and how to use the system the staff also will have an aversion to change. Usually, big organizations get ERP because they want an integrated system for their big team. But SMEs have lean teams. Their purpose for getting ERP or any other solution is to streamline their business procedures. But ERPs usually end up making these procedures even more complicated by involving several modules. Therefore it takes a long time for implementation. And users are intimidated by so many modules.\n\n#### 3\\. Maintenance Cost\n\nImplementing ERP solutions also has maintenance costs attached to it. If managed casually, it leads to the failure of the organization. It requires time to time maintenance which adds up to the recurring cost. Working on a slow system can be very unproductive and frustrating.\n\nERP applications also require sufficient storage and high work performance. Low investment in internal hardware may result in various software issues. And all of this is outside the implementation cost which is a lot. SMEs can't and should not afford ERPs when it is costing them a big chunk of their revenue. Thus we say it again, investing in an easy to use integrated cloud solution is the best decision for SMEs\n\nRead More - [ERP Cost: Key Points To Consider During Software Selection](/blogs/erp-cost-key-points-to-consider-during-software-selection/)\n\n#### Way Forward\n\nSMEs when implementing ERPs should definitely consider the above factors before going with an ERP. Your staff should definitely be comfortable with whichever platform you decide to implement. If you end up deciding that ERPs are not right for your business, it doesn’t mean you can’t digitize your business. You can move to a solution that is affordable and easy to use. [TranZact](/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=3%20Challenges%20SMEs%20Face%20In%20Implementing%20ERP%20Solutions) gives you exactly that.

It will help enhance the effectiveness, profitability, and overall growth of the businesses.

When forecasters rely on outdated data (thanks to excel spreadsheets) the likelihood of inaccurate reordering increases.

Inventory is an important asset and for SME businesses it is quite natural to think of shifting to an ERP system when they start thinking of digitization. But ERPs are complicated and instead of solving inventory problems, you'll have to spend way more time getting yourself and your employees comfortable with the complex software.

Like, crazy expensive. In industrial areas, you can end up paying around lakhs for space. The bigger your operation, the more of a drain on cash resource storage space can become. So having too much inventory on-hand is a real problem for any manufacturer. Good inventory management results in items spending less time sitting in the warehouse before being sold. And this means reduced costs for storing them.\n\nSetting **a clear reorder point for each raw material** allows SME owners to know exactly when to order new stock. This means you should never have too much on-hand at any given moment. It is a specific point that acts as a trigger as soon as stock has diminished to that certain level.\n\nIt’s important to consider the lead time for new stock to be delivered when setting reorder points.

This then understandably discouraged the reps from utilizing the system in the regions in which Avon tested, and the makeup seller lost its reps in droves.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful implementation in Canada, the company discontinued it in other locations as well.

What was supposed to take years had to happen in only a few months or less. Digital Transformation was the only key left for small businesses to survive in the pandemic. Most businesses made an effort to meet this sudden change. Eight out of ten organizations fast-tracked their digital strategy in 2020 according to Dell's [Digital Transformation Index 2020](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/digital-transformation-index.htm#scroll=off&pdf-overlay=/en-us/collaterals/unauth/briefs-handouts/solutions/dt-index-2020-executive-summary.pdf). It surveyed over 4000 business leaders globally. Indian SMEs are no less. A lot of them have stepped up their digital game by adopting digital solutions for business.\n\nRead More - [Digital India: Why Businesses should Go Digital?](/blogs/digital-india-why-businesses-should-go-digital/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=5%20Times%20You'll%20Regret%20Not%20Having%20A%20Digital%20Solution%20For%20Business)\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"Add-a-subheading-1024x538.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\nIn times of COVID-19, when digital solutions are helping businesses run across the world, some traditionally-run MSMEs are going through a tough time. Thus, it is imperative now that MSMEs adopt digitization not only to survive but also to thrive in a post-COVID world.\n\nRead More - [The Way Out For SMEs In COVID Second Wave](/blogs/the-way-out-for-smes-in-covid-second-wave/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=5%20Times%20You'll%20Regret%20Not%20Having%20A%20Digital%20Solution%20For%20Business)\n\n###### Being in the business of providing digital solutions to SMEs we talked to a lot of them about the problems they faced when they weren't using a digital solution. Here are some of those problems-\n\n### 1\\. When employees aren't productive\n\nAre you not sure if your inventory is regularly being updated or have you found loopholes in the recent purchase report? It all maybe because of your employees working from home. Sometimes the mistakes\n\nSometimes the mistakes may not even be your employees' problems but just be mistakes made out of miscommunication.\n\nWorkforce engagement is a hot topic, especially when dealing with employees that are not in the office. Employers are concerned about the transparency of their employees' work in the post COVID world. They are looking for new ways to create productivity improvements. In it 'digital' plays an immense part in helping employees to become more effective in their primary roles both in and out of the office.\n\nDigital transformation provides a valuable opportunity for core business functions in SMEs, such as finance, sales, purchase, etc to move away from manual processes and automate key areas like document data entry, enabling leaders to focus on wider business opportunities.\n\n### 2\\. When Streamlining Operations Becomes A Must\n\n**Do you also wonder how come the whole day passes and nothing seems to get done? Your** **employees' time may be getting wasted on doing back and forth and tallying the repetitive data entries. It's time you move from pen and paper to an automated, cloud-based digital solution for business.** It'll help you streamline process flow access helpful analytics and improve decision-making capabilities. Access to the information also will become simple. Your business will be able to deliver to the market faster and provide detailed digital product representations, all while improving quality and reducing waste.\n\n### 3\\. When your customers want it\n\n**Is your regular client talking endlessly about your competitors' digital invoices and payments? It's time you start thinking about going digital too.**\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of the shift toward a digital solution for business is the ability to store information online. This makes it much more convenient for customers to find the information they want, and often eliminates the need to speak with an employee.  Digital manufacturing helps increase brand awareness, in turn helping businesses provide more customer-specific solutions.\n\n### 4\\. When You Want To Reduce Costs To Make More Profits\n\n**In these tough times, cost reduction is more a matter of necessity than a matter of choice in businesses.** If you want to keep your budget in control then without any doubt your biggest friend is technology! Digital business transformation solutions as a whole cover three major sectors – **operation, strategy,** and **management**. In the operations sector, one can start with processing data in the cloud, digitizing business processes and documents, and optimizing processes. \n\nDigital transformation strategy changes the way business functions by focusing more on customer experience and needs. In the aspect of management, it revamps the entire business model of a company further taking advantage of the commercial and productive opportunities created by the current digital trends. \n\n### 5 You Want To Take Data-Driven Decisions\n\nIn business, there’s always an element of risk, but data-driven decisions make you less vulnerable to risky decisions going wrong. In easy words, **do more of what worked and less of what may or may not work**. It's all based on the data you have collected to make smarter business decisions. Businesses using big data experienced a **profit increase of 8–10%** and **a 10% reduction in overall cost**.\n\nTherefore there’s no doubt that data is a valuable tool for any SME. In fact, companies that use data at the core of their decision-making reduce costs and increase profit. So it's time you move to a digital solution for better data insights.\n\nRead More - [Is Your SME Business Ready For A Digital Solution](/blogs/is-your-team-ready-for-a-digital-solution/)\n\n## Way Forward\n\nBy making the right decisions, you are not only becoming a role-model, but your business will thrive.

The benefits of the inventory management application in the day-to-day operations of a business far outweigh the costs of purchasing and learning how to use it. Inventory management software also provides actionable insights regarding your customer activity, as well as orders, sales, and delivery information. In fact, inventory management software is one of the best ways to increase your business’s profitability and sales.\n\nHere are five ways inventory management software increases profitability and sales:\n\n#### 1\\. Controls inventory in an effective way\n\nA common challenge amongst Indian manufacturers is to maintain the level of stock at a profitable level. More often than not, businesses find themselves spending too much money on excess inventory due to poor inventory management. If not corrected, it can be detrimental to the long-term profitability of the business.\n\nOverstocking goods means having too much money tied up in inventory, which negatively affects both a business’s cash flow and its profitability. However, understocking goods is also a problem. When a company has shortages of a certain product — especially if it’s in demand — they will miss out on sales because their customers end up looking elsewhere to buy those products.\n\nTo gain better control over your inventory, you need high-quality inventory management software. It can help you prevent both overstocking and understocking of your goods by providing you with increased visibility over all your stocks. Using the software, you can get accurate real-time access to inventory information at any time no matter where you are. This means you can easily keep an eye on the levels of goods. You can even set up alerts to let you know which of your stocks are running low so that you can replenish them before they completely run out.\n\nRead More - [Inventory Control: 6 Best Techniques To Follow](/blogs/inventory-control-6-best-techniques-to-follow/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit&utm_campaign=5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit)\n\n#### 2\\. Reduces unnecessary business expenditure\n\nOne of the more significant expenses of your business is undeniably its staffing costs. Inventory management software acts as a tool to streamline your business processes. You no longer need to employ people to handle countless excel sheets, because it will all be taken care of by a single inventory management software.\n\nUnnecessary business expenses due to human error can also be avoided by using inventory management software. It integrates with technology that automatically and accurately updates your inventory data. The use of proven software maximizes accuracy which is essential when it comes to inventory management. This reduces the risk of losing profits over something that can be prevented.\n\nRead More - [Lessons from COVID-19: 4 inventory management strategies](/blogs/lessons-from-covid-19-4-inventory-management-strategies/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit&utm_campaign=5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=5%20Ways%20Inventory%20Management%20Software%20Increases%20Sales%20%26%20Profit)\n\n#### 3\\. Improves Order Fulfillment\n\nOrder fulfillment refers to the movement of your goods. That is, from the point you receive an order, right up to the moment they are delivered to your customer. Here’s how the process goes for most wholesalers and manufacturers.\n\n- The manufacturer receives the customer inquiry.\n- The manufacturer sends a quotation against the inquiry to the customer.\n- Customer sends PO to the manufacturer.\n- PO is converted to a work order and sent to the store team.\n- The store team checks the inventory if they need to order new raw material\n- If yes, then the Purchase team issues a PO to the supplier of raw material.\n- Purchase team hands inventory to store team.\n- The manufacturing team uses inventory for production.\n- Product is dispatched\n\nPlenty of businesses, especially smaller ones such as start-ups, still prefer to do this entire process manually because they think it saves them money. However, as previously mentioned, this isn’t true at all. Manual work creates room for error, and with errors come unexpected costs.\n\nInventory management software provides you with a real-time view of each and every order, as well as what stage of the process the order is in. You can check whether an order has just been received, shipped, or invoiced. It eliminates boring manual data processing and replaces it with automatic data updates. Inventory management makes your workflow more efficient by integrating all the data so you can track orders, prepare invoices, send customer notifications, and accept customer payments within one system.\n\n#### 4\\. Plan For Growth\n\nPlanning for the future is one of the most important tasks of a business owner. You need to think about growth, but you also need to consider potential lean times, especially if you sell or manufacture seasonal products.\n\nWith inventory management software, you can easily plan for your growth and scale your business the right way. As you won't be spending all your time in inventory management you'll get time to explore new markets and diversify its products.\n\n#### 5\\. Enhances customer experience\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing or wholesale, it literally pays to keep existing customers happy. Businesses have about a 60% chance of selling to existing customers versus a slim 5% chance of selling to new customers.\n\nMaintaining the loyalty of your current customers is critical because they will be more recommend your business to other businesses, and therefore provide you with new customers.\n\nSo, if you want to keep your customers happy, one thing you can do for them is to make buying from you easier and even enjoyable. How do you do that, you ask? The answer is simple: use inventory management software. How will it help you? You'll be able to deliver the end product at whatever estimate you gave the customer since you'll have real-time access to all inventory data.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgoTUV3fJ8A?feature=oembed\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" />\n\n#### Way Forward\n\nRemember that with an [effective inventory management](https://erply.com/effective-inventory-management/) system in place, you can help reduce costs, analyze sales patterns and predict future sales, and prepare the business for the unexpected.\n\nWith a proper inventory management system in place, a business has a better chance of profitability and survival. **[TranZact](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit&utm_campaign=5+Ways+Inventory+Management+Software+Increases+Sale+%26+Profit)** is one such platform.

It involves such activities as restocking, ordering, inventory forecasting, and storing. Whether you’re from the e-commerce, manufacturing, or logistics industry, having an efficient inventory management system is essential for your company. \n\nYou may ask: what are the functions of the inventory management system? Some of the functions of inventory management software include improving a company’s productivity and efficiency, preventing stock-outs and over-stock, easy inventory management, and improving profitability. Having an inventory management system in place will enhance your cash flow, help you save money, and most importantly, leverage your customer satisfaction rate. \n\nWondering how to prepare and effectively introduce an inventory management system for your business? Read on to find out. \n\n## 1\\. Evaluate Your Needs and Requirements\n\nBefore investing in inventory management software, you need to ask yourself: what do you want to monitor in your inventory management process? Do you need to keep track of inventory levels?\n\nYou also need to determine the possible solutions you want to get out of your inventory management system, such as:\n\n- Centralized tracking\n- Stock auditing\n- Paperless documentation\n- Optimal service level\n- Automatic reorder points\n- Inventory classifications\n- Dashboard collaboration\n- [Business intelligence dashboard](/blogs/business-intelligence-dashboard-an-ultimate-guide-for-smes/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider&utm_campaign=6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider)\n- Productivity tools\n- Transparent software performance\n\nKnowing your needs and requirements firsthand will help you get the most suitable software for your inventory management processes. \n\n## 2\\. Consider Customization Features\n\nIf you have complex inventory processes and specifications, you need to get an inventory management system with customization features. For example, if you want to get rid of unneeded stock while ensuring you never run out of product, the vendor should know about these concerns. Your provider should also know whether you prefer software that offers insights regarding customer behavior or one with an inventory forecasting function. \n\nFurther, for companies that already have an inventory management system and just want to have additional features, make sure the new software can be easily merged with your existing one. \n\n## 3\\. Think About System Integrations \n\nIntegrations are important in any software. So, for small businesses, the integration of tools may not be a big concern. But if you’re eyeing to grow your business in the future, you should consider it. Even startups have utilized up to four different inventory management systems to simplify their company operations. \n\nSo, a typical example of integrations with other systems is an inventory management tool being integrated with accounting, purchasing, warehouse management, e-commerce, and [tally systems.](/blogs/tally-integration-why-do-indian-smes-businesses-need-it/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider&utm_campaign=6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider) \n\n## 4\\. Consider Flexibility and Usability of Inventory Management Tools\n\nAnother important factor you need to consider before introducing an inventory management system to your business is flexibility and usability. Further, as per [Meili Robots’ statistics](https://www.meilirobots.com/resources-list/e-commerce-statistics), there’s a growing demand for flexible and reliable automated systems to improve retail companies’ productivity and operations.  \n\nSo, before purchasing a new inventory management system, ask yourself: is the software compatible with all types of devices? Is it an on-site or web-based system? You also need to know how many users it can accommodate and if it would be flexible with your different store locations. \n\nAs for usability, you need to learn the ins and outs of the inventory management tool. Remember that your goal is to find a system that will simplify your business processes, so a tool with complicated features isn’t truly worth purchasing. \n\n## 5\\. Examine the Cost of the Software\n\nIf your budget permits it, you can always buy the best and most expensive inventory management software in the market. But if you want to save money, you may opt for the cheaper ones with good quality. However, the price examination doesn’t end there.\n\nThe cost of inventory management systems mostly depends on the complexity or simplicity of your needs and requirements. So, when you enumerate your needs, and the vendor gives you a price, you need to evaluate if it’s just right or too expensive. \n\nThese days, finding worthy software isn’t that difficult anymore. Thanks to the availability of affordable and efficient cloud-based solutions fit for startups, small businesses, or companies with low budgets. According to a [survey by Meili Robots](https://www.meilirobots.com/resources-list/e-commerce-statistics), automation and cloud-based software are getting more popular in the material handling equipment industry. \n\n## 6\\. Learn the Best Inventory Management Practices and Techniques\n\nLast but not least is that you should learn the best inventory management techniques. By doing so, you can effectively implement the inventory management tool in your business and make the most out of it. \n\nSome of the best inventory management practices include:\n\n- [Economic and minimum order quantities](/blogs/economic-order-quantity-how-eoq-is-useful-for-sme-businesses/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider&utm_campaign=6+Tips+on+Introducing+Inventory+Management+System+to+Your+Business%3A+How+to+Prepare+for+It+and+What+to+Consider)\n- ABC analysis \n- Safety stock inventory\n- Just-in-time inventory management\n- First-in, first-out method\n- Last-in, first-out method\n- Batch tracking\n- Dropshipping\n\nAside from learning the best practices, training employees would also be crucial when introducing an inventory management system to the company. Hence, the need for employees with relevant educational backgrounds and experience, such as the [best online supply chain management bachelor's degree](https://research.com/degrees/online-bachelors-degrees-in-supply-chain-management), would be beneficial. \n\n## Introduce an Outstanding Inventory Management System to Your Business\n\nImplementing inventory management systems to your business processes can be challenging, especially if inventory management is something that’s overlooked in your company.

All the transactions take place through electronic channels. Going **cashless** eases one's life. It also helps formalize the transactions. Further, it helps to curb corruption. And also, the flow of black money that results in an increase in **economic growth**.\n\nNow, in the situation of this global coronavirus pandemic. The people of all statures got to know about the benefits of cash-less economic transactions.\n\nMany of us from the events of Lockdowns and till now are afraid to use the currency notes. And we tend to sanitize them as soon as we reach our homes. Because we all fear that this currency may carry the virus, and that's why we don't want to use it.\n\nAdditionally, in the event of complete lockdown, many of us were unable to withdraw money from banks and ATMs. Due to this problem, we started using UPI and other digital payment options to purchase goods. And further, we understood the importance of these payment methods.\n\nThe same thing is happening with everyone around the world. So we all, with corporate and business houses, are shifting towards cashless transactions.\n\nSo to help you all understand the efforts Government is taking to make India a Cashless Economy, we have prepared this article. And we think that with this blog, you can assess what our state is doing for us and how we can contribute and improve it. Let's begin with it. \n\n- [**Past efforts of Indian Government for making a Cashless Economy.**](#Past-efforts-of-Indian-Government-for-making-a-Cashless-Economy.)\n- [**Why should India be a Cashless Economy?**](#Why-should-India-be-a-Cashless-Economy?)\n- [**Measures taken by the Indian Government?**](#Measures-taken-by-the-Indian-Government?)\n- [**Way Forward**.](#Way-Forward)\n\n<blog-image alt=\"cash less economy\" image=\"money.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\n## Past efforts of Indian Government for making a Cashless Economy.\n\nThe Finance Minister announced in the [Union Budget 2019-20](https://www.iasexpress.net/mindmap-union-budget-2019-20-highlights-read-revise-faster/) that **TDS @ 2%** will get charged on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs.1 crore in a year from the bank account. The motive behind this particular announcement of our government was to discourage businesses' cash payments transactions. \n\nAdditionally, to promote digital transactions among corporate houses. The government announced that companies with an annual turnover of over Rs.50 crore to offer low-cost digital payment modes. Moreover, the state is giving them the benefit of no additional or Merchant Discount Rate charges on them and their customers.\n\nIt is an excellent move by the Indian Government to incentivize people to adapt to the emerging cashless economy. \n\nNearly 90% of all transactions in the Indian economy were dependent on cash before the pandemic. It's because of the large informal sector that employs 90% of the labor. India cannot become cashless unless this sector adapts to digital payments.\n\nIncentivizing the people alone is not sufficient. The government needs to develop the supporting infrastructures and technologies for India to become a cashless economy.\n\n## Why should India be a Cashless Economy?\n\nIndia should shift to a cashless economy. The reasons for this statement are as follows:\n\n- **Cash is expensive:** A lot of time and money goes into printing cash. RBI has spent Rs.32.1 billion on printing the currency. Also, there is the cost for the setting up of and maintaining of the ATMs. Furthermore, the paper currencies have shelf-life after which it needs to get replaced.\n- **Cash is the driver of the shadow economy**: Cash is difficult to trace. Illegal activities like tax evasion, black money, etc can also be carried out with cash. In 2007, currency in circulation was almost on par with the bank deposits. However, in the last three years, the currency with Indians was more than the bank deposits by 50%. The amount of black money (unaccounted money) in India is 15-16 lakh crores. It may get used to finance illegal activities like terrorist activities, purchasing votes, smuggling, betting, trafficking, etc.\n- **Enables financial inclusion and increased tax revenues**: A cashless economy makes it necessary for all citizens to have bank accounts. This will ensure a higher financial inclusion rate. It will also guarantee transparency in the transaction of money within the economy – minimizing the possibility of tax evasion exponentially.\n\n## Measures taken by the Indian Government?\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Indian Government steps for building a Cashless Economy\" image=\"1-1.png\"></blog-image>\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Measures taken up by Government of Indian for building a Cashless Economy\" image=\"2.png\"></blog-image>\n\n#### **Demonetization** \n\nDemonetisation drive has not curbed the black money. However, it had pushed India towards being a cashless economy. It has become a radical **\"reform\"** to transform India into a cashless economy. Paytm witnessed **5 million** daily usage post demonetization as opposed to their average transaction of **3 million.** \n\nAdditionally, [**Paytm**](https://paytm.com/) was seeing a **700% increase** in its **overall traffic**. And a **1000% increase** in the amount of **money added to its account** within the first two days of post-demonetization. Further, **[Ola Money](https://www.olamoney.com/)** was seeing a **1500% increase** in its **e-wallet**.\n\n#### **Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana**\n\nOne of the biggest financial inclusion initiatives in the world was launched in 2014. [Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana](https://pmjdy.gov.in/) is a national mission of [financial inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_inclusion#:~:text=Financial%20inclusion%20is%20defined%20as,%2C%20equity%2C%20and%20insurance%20products.). It has an integrated approach to bring comprehensive financial inclusion and provide banking services to all households within the country.\n\nThis scheme ensures access to a range of financial services like availability of basic savings, bank accounts, access to need-based credit, insurance, and pension. It has played a significant role in the opening of bank accounts for the poor.\n\n#### **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)**\n\nThe Indian Government launched the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to provide the benefits of subsidies and other transfers directly in the beneficiaries' bank accounts. The welfare scheme in which the DBT system is getting used is **LPG subsidy, Old Age Pension, Scholarship,** [**MGNREGA**](https://nrega.nic.in/netnrega/home.aspx)**, etc**. And these all efforts allowed for the penetration of digital banking into rural India.\n\n#### **Unified Payment Interface (UPI)**\n\n[Unified Payment Interface (UPI)](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview) is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating banks). It merges several banking features, seamless fund routing, and merchant payments into one hood. And this system is what makes digital transactions a simplified process. Cash-less monthly transactions via UPI have increased from **Nil to 754 million** in less than 3 years.\n\n#### Digishala\n\nThe Government of India has launched Digishala, a free Doordarshan DTH channel to educate and inform the people about the various modes of digital payments. It helps people understand UPI, USSD, AEPS, e-wallets, debit, and credit cards. This initiative will help the rural population of India know about these digital payment modes. Further, it will make them shift to becoming a cashless economy.\n\n#### Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)\n\nThe payment service of **\\*99#,** which everyone must have heard of, works on the [Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data) channel. It allows mobile banking transactions using the basic feature of mobile phones. Further, there is no need to have a mobile internet data facility for using USSD based mobile banking. And this initiative of the state helps in the financial inclusion of underbanked society in the mainstream banking services.\n\n#### Aadhar Enabled Payment System (AEPS)\n\nAadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) is a digital payment model that uses the Unique Identification Number for payment transfers. Additionally, it allows Aadhaar card-holders to perform the financial transaction at PoS centers. By using the Business Correspondent (BC)/Bank Mitra of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication.\n\n#### **Financial Literacy Centres**\n\nThis was a part of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna. This initiative has provided financial education programs to spread awareness of banking products and benefits.\n\nIn this year's budget, our FM announced earmarking Rs 1,500 crores for a proposed scheme to promote a digital mode of payment. This scheme is to further boost the digital revolution in the country.\n\nDue to these combined initiatives. Further with the increase in internet and technological availability and affordability. The movement of Indian households in both rural and urban sectors is starting to show a shift from 90% cash-based to a larger rate of cashless economy.\n\n## Way Forward\n\n- **A targeted financial education** **drive** can be undertaken by the government to improve the knowledge of e-transactions to the public, even the illiterate.\n- The banks must make sure that the **transaction fee** is either **free** or **affordable** to all.\n- The banks must encourage the **opening of zero balance accounts** to encourage the poor to make use of the bank accounts.\n- The government must improve **internet connectivity** in **rural India** and **other isolated regions**.\n- Availability of ATMs in rural and suburban areas should be ensured. Just the availability of bank accounts alone cannot address the problem of India being overly dependent on cash.\n- SMEs should also start operating cashless. There are a lot of benefits for SMEs if they adopt the digital form of payments. For example, there will always a record if whatever transaction has been made.

There are a number of reasons why businessmen are moving towards digital documentation. Some of them may be, the ability to access information from anywhere or working together on documents, or backup and security of documents, etc.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Digital_documentation\" image=\"document-mngmnt.png\"></blog-image>\n\nAlthough becoming entirely digital might still be seen as a risk. Therefore, digitizing certain processes and document workflows can reduce costs and save time and increase productivity. Many times finding workflow to digitize is a struggle too. A good place to start in such cases is to start with the most repetitive tasks or the ones that are most error-prone. Many platforms are also out there that will help you digitize your business workflows in an easy manner. [TranZact](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Digital%20Documentation%3A%205%20Benefits%20for%20SMEs) is one of those platforms that is designed for SMEs to digitize & streamline their business processes.\n\nRead More - [Digital India: Why Businesses should Go Digital?](/blogs/digital-india-why-businesses-should-go-digital/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Digital%20Documentation%3A%205%20Benefits%20for%20SMEs)\n\nIf adopting digital documentation of your business is on your agenda for 2021, here are some of the key benefits for doing so:\n\n### **1) Improved customer experience**\n\nCustomers expect good service and experiences. While customers can be forgiving, document workflows can slow down a customer interaction or even spoil it!\n\nConsider all of the times where you have received poor customer service where a document has played a significant role. For example, the contract is in the post but it never turns up for you to sign or you lose your paper receipt so you have no proof of purchase. etc.\n\nBy digital documentation of these workflows, you can benefit from faster communications and processes with customers. Therefore it will make the customer journey better and easier for everyone!\n\n### **2) Increased employee productivity**\n\nIn SMEs, the ability to share and work on information is important. Without important information, employees fall behind on tasks and their productivity goes down.\n\nSharing information through hard copies is slow. Also working together on a document becomes extremely difficult. Paper also has no version control or audit tracking.\n\nBy digitizing document workflows, such data can be shared throughout the business, instantly and regardless of location. As a result, productivity will increase.\n\n### 3) ** Reduction in overheads and increased revenue**\n\nPaper processes can be expensive and time-consuming, especially where printing is not necessary. By identifying common, heavy paper processes within the business, it’s possible to identify which processes can be digitized.\n\nBy removing the heavy paper processes from the business, you can save on print costs and increase the time that employees spend on higher-value tasks.\n\nA good [digital solution](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Digital%20Documentation%3A%205%20Benefits%20for%20SMEs) provider can guide you through this process to ensure you make the most out of it and get the highest return on investment.\n\n### **4) Improved compliance and Data security**\n\n[Data security](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323943) can often be a roadblock for digitization based on compliance. There's always a fear that data being stored digitally can somehow be hacked or accessed. But as a matter of fact, storing data digitally can help a company remain compliant with data protection laws so long as it’s set up properly.\n\nBy using a solution where data security is paramount you can ensure that your data isn't misused. Digital solutions like [TranZact](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Digital%20Documentation%3A%205%20Benefits%20for%20SMEs) have integrated multiple layers of security measures to keep all your sensitive data completely safe, secure, and end-to-end encrypted.\n\n##### Read More - [Data Security In Digital Solution: 3 Tips For Business Owners](/blogs/data-security-in-digital-solution-3-tips-for-business-owners/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Data%20Security%20In%20Digital%20Solution%3A%203%20Tips%20For%20Business%20Owners)\n\n### 5) Space-saving\n\nStoring a large amount of paperwork can be a problem. This problem will also keep increasing as paperwork to store would keep increasing as your business grows.\n\nMany employees can also be working from separate sites and locations especially during the pandemic. Thus problems can arise around having to transport paperwork. A digital document management system will ensure that space can be put to better use.\n\nBusiness premises visited by clients can become more aesthetically pleasing, with fewer bundles of paper and documents lying around. You will also be reducing the carbon footprint on the society.\n\n## Way Forward\n\nWorkflow automation technology allows automation of high-value, high-volume activities such as data capture, data validation, look-ups, and data distribution. This helps in the quality analysis of data for the growth of the business.\n\nApart from all these benefits, going paperless will ensure business continuity in case some disaster happens. There are a lot of challenges surrounding the digitization of document workflows. Some of them lie within the culture of the business, others are based on time and cost. However, if you can identify with the above five benefits as something your business requires then your business will benefit highly from digitization.\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/digital-documentation-5-benefits-for-smes","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2021-12-29T05:41:09.305Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1640756562559},"$loki":44},{"slug":"digital-india-why-businesses-should-go-digital","description":"The vision of Digital India is enabling radically new ways for SMEs to deliver value to their customers such as mobile apps, digital tools, etc.","title":"Digital India: Why Businesses should Go Digital?","createdAt":"2020-12-15T17:24:30.000Z","categories":["business"],"tags":["digital-transformation","digital-transformation-in-business","digital-transformation-strategy","digitization","digitize-india"],"coverImage":"80ae4d_3b71748cf7ea4088a166b891e0b36147_mv2.jpg","toc":[{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"why-achieve-digitalization-now","depth":2,"text":"WHY ACHIEVE DIGITALIZATION NOW?"},{"id":"helps-to-move-towards-cashless-economy","depth":3,"text":"Helps to move towards Cashless Economy"},{"id":"digital-technologies-help-to-reach-a-bigger-market","depth":3,"text":"Digital technologies help to reach a bigger market"},{"id":"embracing-digital-technologies-generates-revenue","depth":3,"text":"Embracing digital technologies generates revenue. "},{"id":"security-of-company-data","depth":3,"text":"Security of company data"},{"id":"the-value-that-presence-of-digitalization-brings","depth":2,"text":"THE VALUE THAT PRESENCE OF DIGITALIZATION BRINGS:"},{"id":"they-help-transcend-geographical-boundaries","depth":3,"text":"They help transcend geographical boundaries"},{"id":"value-addition-for-our-customer","depth":3,"text":"Value addition for our customer"},{"id":"it-helps-increase-sales","depth":3,"text":"It helps increase sales:"},{"id":"it-eases-marketing","depth":3,"text":"It eases marketing"},{"id":"it-helps-in-the-creation-of-a-brand","depth":3,"text":"It helps in the creation of a Brand"},{"id":"social-engagement-that-involves-information-sharing","depth":3,"text":"Social Engagement that involves information sharing"},{"id":"way-forward-in-digital-india","depth":2,"text":"Way Forward In Digital India"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"India has seen a dream of Digital India.

This format consists of numbers that are zeroes and ones. It is the use of digital technologies to convert information into a digital format. But when put to application in the real world, Digitization has the power to transform mankind into a realm that no one could have imagined a century earlier.\n\nThese technologies are remarkable and are converging together to transform the way businesses are conducted. Clever software, novel materials, better robots with IoT, new processes (notably 3Dprinting), data analytics, and a whole range of intelligent web-based services courtesy of AI and machine learning.  The factory of the past was based on creating identical products. **But now is the age of extensive customization which is what factories of the future would focus upon.** For this to happen, our businesses would need to undergo a digital transformation.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"Digital-760x428-800x325-fill-constrain-q90-meta_image.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\n## **WHY ACHIEVE DIGITALIZATION NOW?**\n\nWhy does digital transformation need to be acted upon now?\n\nSMEs can look within themselves as to what **essentially their business needs to achieve**. This could chiefly be -- **ways to deliver value to customers**, **creating a competitive field for their products**, **generating revenue to sustain and expand their business, and** **data security**.\n\nNow does digitalization help them achieve this? It does.\n\nHow? Let’s see.\n\n[**Digital technologies are enabling radically new ways to deliver value to customers.**](/blogs/how-can-smes-optimize-production-process-by-going-digital/)\n\nThe digital penetration in our country has increased a lot due to the Government of India initiatives like **Digital India** and **Skill India** and t**he JAM trinity.** We have a digital population of over 480 million. 390 million of that access the internet via their mobile phones. So **by creating mobile apps and websites**, one can provide better, quicker, and value-driven services to their customers.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"Screenshot-2020-12-14-at-9.01.21-AM.png\"></blog-image>\n\nFor example, **India has more than 200 e-pharmacies** with more on the way, most popular among them being **1mg, Medline, Netmeds, Pharmeasy, and Myra**. Not only this, few SMEs in the textile industry like **Anouk** and **Gerua** sold their products on established e-commerce websites and developed a loyal customer base. Later, they started their own websites as well.\n\n**Read more on, [How Digitization and Domestic manufacturing Can Help India Grow](/blogs/how-digitization-and-domestic-manufacturing-can-help-india-grow/)**\n\n### Helps to move towards Cashless Economy\n\nThe benefits of a cashless economy are not a news to anyone. It saves the printing costs of currency and eliminates frauds of fake currency.  Cash is difficult to trace. Illegal activities like tax evasion, black money, etc can also be carried out with cash. Therfore, going digital with all the all the transactions promotes a cashless economy. The government has initiated several schemes and programmes to promote digital payments in small businesses.\n\n**Read more on [how becoming a cashless economy is important to India](/blogs/cashless-economy-how-is-it-important-for-india/) and what measures has government taken to promote it.**\n\n### **Digital technologies help to reach a bigger market** \n\nWith the onset of pandemic [going digital is the only way to survive for businesses](/blogs/the-way-out-for-smes-in-covid-second-wave/). By **achieving a transformation of the domain in their businesses, digital technology has altered competitive landscapes.** Flipkart started this when they developed a strong digital infrastructure. It started a website from where the most basic household goods to the newest gadgets can all be accessed. It was essentially like having a virtual stroll down Walmart for Digital India\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"Walmart_grocery_mobile_0.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nMany SMEs in Digital India followed the same model. Not only this, they took it a step ahead and ventured into the food hospitality sector where apps like Zomato and Swiggy scored big. Real Estate got itself MagicBricks.com. Manufacturing companies like Patanjali and SMEs like Tijori Ayurvedic Skincare also have their own websites to sell their goods. \n\n### **Embracing digital technologies generates revenue**. \n\nThey save costs and time. Documents are stored in digital format and stored in the cloud, optimizing expenses. There is less office space required and stationery costs are reduced. Printing, sorting, filing requires tons of billable working hours and enhances the cost of the product. Companies like [TranZact](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=%22Digital%20India%3A%20Why%20Businesses%20should%20Go%20Digital%3F%20%22) are helping SMEs achieve this by providing an easy platform for them to digitize their business\n\n**[Read more](/blogs/ways-to-help-your-team-yourself-keep-up-with-the-digital-transformation/) on Ways to Help Your Team (& Yourself) Keep Up with the Digital Transformation.**\n\nPerformance and productivity improvement happens on a massive scale.

Multiple stores required huge manpower. But today it is not so. Now products get a global reach, they can be accessed and processed anywhere irrespective of location. The offerings are extended to any Internet user, no matter the region of the country. Having access to warehouses at places and people to manage them can transform businesses. For example, **Vinod Cookware** was initially confined to areas in Mumbai and Palghar where their factory is situated.

Customers get filters that help them lead to their desired products with just a few clicks. There is a presence of reviews and rating system which helps other customers in their future purchases. For example, themessycorner.in which started as a place to buy personalized travel accessories has its own fan base now all over the nation.

Today they have managed to give people an alternative to Amul.  In the long run, they might even compete with Amul.\n\n### **Social Engagement that involves information sharing**\n\n**An average person spends 2.4 hours on social media**. If a business has an active social media handle, it helps in increasing product visibility. They also get to engage with consumers on a one-to-one level through podcasts, webinars, and social media posts. Thus digital transformation gives an opportunity to showcase their products and educate their customers at the same time. With so many advantages and opportunities in the offing, it's important to capitalize on it. It's important to do this quickly **to create a niche for yourself in your chosen field.**  It's a race where you have to participate. The good thing is one doesn’t necessarily have to win it, participation is more than enough.\n\nOne could talk about the wonders of digitalization all the time. How it quickens processes, enhances connectivity, and access leading to building meaningful relationships is something which we have been hearing for a long time. One may ask if there’s any concrete proof of the same?\n\n##### The proof is in numbers which have changed so dramatically.\n\nWe are aware of how the titans in the business world today were once small businesses themselves. Companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Facebook, Netflix all acted by hitting the iron when it was hot**.** They spurred themselves and became unparalleled global leaders in their fields to the point of affecting even further digital penetration.\n\n- In 2007, 94% of the world’s information storage capacity was digital. This was a complete reversal from 1986 when 99.2% of all storage capacity was analog.\n- Itunes sold more music than Walmart in 2008.\n- Amazon.com sold more Kindle books than print books in 2011\n- In December 2012,  annual e-commerce sales top $1 trillion worldwide for the first time.\n- In 2017, online advertising (203.59 UDS) surpassed TV advertising (184.46 USD) worldwide. It had already done so for newspaper advertising in 2012\n- Since 2008, there has been a decline of almost 86% courtesy of digital platforms like Netflix, HBO, Hotstar, and whatnot.\n- As of April 2020, the global digital population is 4.66 billion.\n\nBy going digital not only they have **managed to alter the consumer consumption patterns but** in doing so, **have created entire business domains for themselves.** This has created certain realities that can no longer be ignored. Therefore, to stay relevant, SMEs must move towards accepting digitalization.\n\n**Read more about [5 Times SMEs Regret Not Having A Digital Solution For Business](/blogs/5-times-youll-regret-not-having-a-digital-solution-for-business/)**\n\n## Way Forward In Digital India\n\nTechnological change is nothing new—but this round of change is happening at a rate faster than ever before. Some executives cite this transformation as ‘disruptive technologies’; that risk is certainly real.\n\nBut if one does not evolve with the world, they are likely to be left behind. While new technologies may threaten established businesses, they can also create unprecedented opportunities. \n\nAn increasing number of executives are more concerned with missing opportunities to grow. It is not digital disruption that is impelling companies to change, it is digital “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out). \n\nBeing bombarded with such diverse options from all sides can be overwhelming. This is why the primary goal should be to enforce digital transformation with a clear cut vision. **The strategy should lead to innovation.**\n\nThe entire nation has joined hands to make the dream of a Digital India into a reality. Youngsters are enthusiastic, industry is supportive and the government is proactive. India is yearning for a digital revolution.\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/digital-india-why-businesses-should-go-digital","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2021-12-29T05:41:09.305Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1640756562615},"$loki":45},{"slug":"digitization-to-increase-profitability","description":"87% of business executives set digitization as the top priority in their business after the pandemic.

And the E-way bill implementation is making further addition to this drive. E-way bill making transportation of goods from one state to another or within one state (intra-state) much more comfortable. It is doing so by minimizing the compliances which the governments were exercising in the earlier tax regime. All this is going on because of the E-Way Bill rules and now with its new integration of the FasTag and RFID. Through this up-gradation, the E-Way Bill system can receive real-time details of commercial vehicle movements on the highways and the tolls they are crossing.\n\n## What is an E-Way Bill?\n\nE-Way Bill is an Electronic [Way Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waybill) document introduced by the GST system to evidence the movement of goods.  The [government's E-way Bill Portal](https://ewaybill.nic.in/) generates the E-way Bill document. This E-way Bill generation is compulsory for all taxable goods whose invoice value is more than Rs.50,000. The E-way bill is required for all GST registered persons if their invoice value exceeds the limit. And the transportation of goods is happening within (intra-state) or outside (inter-state) the state.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"E-Way Bill\" image=\"E-Way-Bill-1.png \"E-Way Bill\"\"></blog-image>\n\nThe purpose of the E-Way Bill is to generate a Unique E-way Bill Number (EBN) that all the parties (supplier/transporter/recipient) involved in the transaction have. And through that authorities, can ensure that this movement of goods complies with the [GST Law](https://services.gst.gov.in/services/gstlaw/gstlawlist). Further, this E-way Bill mechanism is an effective tool to track the transportation of goods and check tax evasion.\n\n## E-way Bill Rules - Who should generate it?\n\nAccording to [Rule 138 of the CGST Rules, 2017,](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/51_GST_Flyer_Chapter18.pdf) the E-way Bill generation takes place when transportation of goods price more than Rs.50,000 is to be done through any conveyance method. And this transportation is happening because of Sale of goods, branch transfers, or any other reasons.\n\nSo the consignor or the consignee who can be registered or unregistered persons have to create E-way Bills. If the movement of goods is done through their own/hired vehicle or by railways, airways, waterways methods. In the case of transportation by the road with the help of Transporters, then Transporter only has to generate it or part of it.\n\nRead More about - [The Ins and Outs Of GST Filing.](/blogs/the-ins-and-outs-of-gst-filing/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=E-Way+Bill+-+Ultimate+Guide+for+SMEs+About+E-Way+Bill+Rules)\n\n## E-way Bill Rules - Validity of E-Way Bill\n\nThe question which many people are searching for is the validity of E-way Bills or what is the distance limit of E-way Bills. So to clarify the distance limits, the E-way Bill is mandatory for even 1-kilometer movement. But there is a relaxation for the distance less than 50 kilometers. That only the Part A of the E-Way Bill has to be filled.\n\nNow coming to the validity of E-Way Bills, it means for what period is the particular E-Way Billis valid to use. The validity depends on the distance of the destination of goods transported. And the calculation of the validity period depends on the date and time of generation of the E-way bill.\n\nFor a distance less than 100 kilometers, the E-Way Bill is valid for 1 day only. Additionally, whenever the distance increases by 100 Kms or part-off, the addition of 1 day goes on to the earlier validity period.\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Distance</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Validity Period</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>D&lt;100 Kms.</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>1 Day.</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Addition of every 100 Kms.<br>or part-off.</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>1-Day addition to the original validity period.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nIf the validity period of the E-Way Bill is coming to expire and the goods are still on the way. Then the Transporter can generate another E-Way Bill by updating the details in Part B of FORM GST EWB-01.\n\n## E-Way Bill Components\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Part B of FORM GSTR EWB-01\" image=\"E-Way-Bill-System-Fig-2-1024x630.png\"></blog-image>\n\nThe E-Way Bill has two components which are Part A and Part B. The **Part A of Form [GSTR EWB-01](https://www.gstzen.in/a/form-gst-ewb-01.html)** is filled by the consignor or consignee, who must be a registered person. And for the **Part B of Form [GSTR EWB-01](https://www.gstzen.in/a/form-gst-ewb-01.html)**, the Transporter fills the detail. But the situation changes when the suppliers or buyers own/hire vehicles to get used, then either of the two files Part B.\n\nRead More about - [What is GST Invoice & GST E-Invoicing-5 Problems SMEs face?](/blogs/what-is-gst-invoice-gst-e-invoicing-5-problems-smes-face/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=E-Way+Bill+-+Ultimate+Guide+for+SMEs+About+E-Way+Bill+Rules)\n\n## How to Generate an E-Way Bill\n\n<blog-image alt=\"E-Way Bill Portal\" image=\"maxresdefault.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nAccording to the E-Way Bill Rules, the concerned parties can generate the E-Way using the GST Portal. There are two methods by which they can fill the details required in Part A and Part B of GSTR EWB-01. By entering the details manually on the portal or by using the JSON file, which has the Tax Invoice details of the goods whose transportation is in process.\n\n## How TranZact helps SMEs with E-Way Bills.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mc6jK3rxPTo?feature=oembed\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" />\n\n[TranZact](/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=E-Way+Bill+-+Ultimate+Guide+for+SMEs+About+E-Way+Bill+Rules) is a digital transformation tool and platform for SMEs to digitize business processes right, from customer inquiry to dispatch.

Further, every business needs to manage its inventories to fulfill its customer’s needs. So, in maintaining these inventories, the activity of re-ordering the raw materials you all use takes place. And in this particular situation, many small businesses make the mistake of ordering only that much quantity of products they need at that time. Instead of doing this, you all can use the **Economic Order Quantity formula (EOQ)** to enhance the way you order and pay for these goods.\n\nNow, before talking more about the benefits and usage of the Economic Order of Quantity formula. Let’s take a glance at what it means.\n\n## What is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)?\n\n![Economic Order Quantity | TranZact](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSLn-ASLSBXbpNDcYhy1AZN4PbA0JEORxx9ww&usqp=CAU)\n\nThe term EOQ (whose full form is Economic Order Quantity) is an optimum order quantity (or in some case levels) of goods that the organization needs to consider while purchasing the products to minimize their inventory [holding costs](http://www.leanmanufacture.net/operations/holdingcosts.aspx), order costs, and inventory costs.\n\nSo, to make it clearer, the EOQ is a formula for calculating the optimum quantity of raw materials a company needs to purchase while giving the order for that requirement. With its help, the cost of warehousing or stocking the materials, logistics costs, and the purchase price all get reduced to a minimum level. And this happens because of a particular order quantity size.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dYofsnUjA\n\nThe mathematical formula of Economic Order Quantity is –\n\n**EOQ = Square Root of ((2\\*S\\*D)/H)**\n\n**S** stands for Setup costs (per order).\n\n**D** stands for Demand Rate (goods quantity sold in this year).\n\n**H** stands for Holding costs (per year, per unit).\n\nRead More about - [Inventory Management: Ultimate Guide for SMEs](/blogs/inventory-management-ultimate-guide-for-smes/?utm_source=Website+&utm_medium=Blog+-+Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.&utm_campaign=Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.)\n\n## Why you all must use EOQ?\n\nApart from helping you all out in managing your purchase time order quantities. The EOQ formula aids businesses in many other ways. So here are some advantages which the Economic Order of Quantity formula provides to companies.\n\n#### 1\\. Reduces Inventory Costs.\n\nIf you use the old way to give the order of goods, you may order and hold goods that have low velocity for sale. And due to this, they occupy your storage space and involve maintenance and many other costs. But with the help of EOQ, you can remove this type of error while you are ordering. Further, it will help in improving your Capital situation. And these additional funds can get a better utilization in some other way in the business.\n\n#### 2\\. Reduces Stockout Situation.\n\nWith the help of the Economic Order of Quantity formula, the business can easily manage its inventory levels. Further, they can decide the re-order points. And with the optimum quantity, it will help to remove the possibility of a stockout situation in the organization.\n\nRead More about - [What is the Significance of Accurate Inventory Levels?](/blogs/the-importance-of-accurate-inventory-levels/?utm_source=Website+&utm_medium=Blog+-+Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.&utm_campaign=Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.)\n\n#### 3\\. Progress in Customer Happiness.\n\nIn the event when the customer has made an order, he doesn't get his product at the promised time. It becomes the most terrible experience for the customer. But with the help of the EOQ formula, the companies maintain proper inventory levels. So they can fulfill these customer orders at a time which improves the customer's experience with the organization.\n\n#### 4\\. Enhances Overall Performance.\n\nWith the help of EOQ calculations, the organization can manage all its product lines easily. Further, they can more efficiently handle their Capital needs and make better business decisions. Because all their decisions will be based upon the essential data facts generated with EOQ and its calculation process.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enEaSraUzrM?feature=oembed\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" />\n\nRead More about - [Inventory Control: Six Best Techniques To Follow](/blogs/inventory-control-6-best-techniques-to-follow/?utm_source=Website+&utm_medium=Blog+-+Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.&utm_campaign=Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.)\n\n## Way Forward\n\nWith the above discussions, you all may now understand the importance of Economic Order Quantity in a company. So if you are a very small business dealing with only one product, you may consider calculating the EOQ manually. But if you are dealing with multiple products calculating the EOQ for each product every time you order is a very difficult task. And that is why you need a software application to do this task for you. It will do all these calculations quickly with no errors, and you can make efficient decisions on the basis of this data.\n\nRead More about - [6 ‘Must Haves’ Features For Your Inventory Software](/blogs/6-must-haves-features-for-your-inventory-software/?utm_source=Website+&utm_medium=Blog+-+Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.&utm_campaign=Economic+Order+Quantity+-+How+EOQ+is+useful+for+SME+Businesses.)\n\nSo to help you in this, there are many software applications in the market.

Many ERP vendors charge on a per-user basis, meaning the more people who use it, the more expensive it gets. You also need to account for the cost of adding new users to your system. How that expense could increase in the future as your company grows. You’ll need to check with the specific ERP you’re interested in to see if they charge per-user. This is important especially if you have a large number of employees who will need access, as the costs will add up.\n\n##### 2\\. **Add-Ons/Customization**\n\nAdd ons and customization in ERPs are not cheap. That is why finding a software/solution that fulfills all your immediate needs should be a priority. Many vendors offer integrations with third-party add-ons or the option to include specific modules for increased functionality in your program. The cost of these additional capabilities differs depending on what you decide to include and which vendor you go with for your base package. You should take this factor into consideration along with ERP cost.\n\n##### 3\\. Number Of Modules\n\nAn ERP usually has these following modules-\n\n- Finance\n- Procurement\n- Manufacturing\n- Inventory Management\n- Order Management\n- Warehouse Management\n- Supply Chain Management\n- Customer Relationship Management\n- Professional Services Automation\n- Workforce Management\n- Human Resources Management\n- Ecommerce\n- Marketing Automation\n\nAs good as all of these modules look, a lot of them may not be useful for SMEs. An SME usually doesn’t have an HR department or a workforce management department. They also won’t need marketing automation for a business their size. So a lot of what small businesses will pay as ERP cost will actually not be useful. This should be taken into consideration before making such a hefty investment.\n\n##### 4\\. Implementation Strategy\n\nDepending on the technical expertise of your internal employees, you may have to leverage an ERP consultant to help make the process of implementing an ERP system more simple. Most SME owners face a lot of problems in the implementation of ERP as these systems are complicated mostly meant for big companies who are not new to the concept of digitization.\n\nIf you are implementing ERP for the first time, you will likely need more dedicated technical assistance than a company that has experience deploying this type of program. Hiring an ERP consultant is also not cheap for any business. So this makes it a key factor to consider when looking for the best ERP software for your business.\n\nRead More - [Why Does ERP Implementation Take So Much Time](/blogs/why-does-erp-implementation-take-so-much-time/)\n\n##### 5\\. Deployment method\n\nThe upfront cost of deploying an ERP solution on-premise is more expensive than that of a cloud-based program. There are pros and cons to both of these deployment methods, with upfront payment being one aspect that makes cloud deployment more appealing to some businesses. If you’re more interested in an on-premise solution though, you should remember that although upfront costs are higher. Companies with cloud ERP software end up paying a lot because of the add-ons/customization without even knowing if the system has been successfully implemented or not.\n\n##### 6\\. Training & Customer Support\n\nTraining and customer support are two essential components to consider when estimating the cost of an ERP solution and how well a program will work with your company’s needs. Support and maintenance costs make up, on average, 15-20% of a software budget, making it a big chunk of your price consideration when it comes to calculating ERP cost.

Unrealistic Implementation Project Timeline, Budget, and Resources\n\nIn a [2018 ERP Report](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2184246/2018%20ERP%20Report.pdf), it was found that a majority of projects spend more time, money, and resources than expected. This is often because expectations were unrealistic, to begin with, which leads to a number of poor decisions in the future. When businesses don't have resources to keep the slow implementation running it results in an ERP disaster.\n\nIt’s important to add a dose of reality to any sales proposal or implementation plan that you might receive from an ERP vendor or reseller.

Most of them can only handle [Tally](https://tallysolutions.com/) and [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/excel).\n\nOn the other hand ERPs are complex and are essentially meant for businesses bigger than SMEs. Thus when the time comes to use the software most of the employees are resistant to shift as they don't have proper training. Thus this results in an ERP disaster.\n\nSo it’s important that your executive team be involved in key decisions surrounding your project. They also need to be involved in ongoing decisions surrounding key business decisions, changes to business processes and other strategic considerations.\n\n#### 3\\. Unclear Business Processes and Requirements\n\nClear business processes and requirements provide the direction that every project team needs to be successful. Without them, projects are more likely to go over budget. They also take longer than expected to complete and fail to meet the organization’s broader strategic intent.\n\nIt’s important to take the time to complete this step before beginning the ERP implementation process.

You don’t have a contingency budget\n\nMost projects don’t go exactly as planned, so it’s important to not blindly trust any vendors' claims. Don't go for upfront payment. Instead choose to pay on a monthly or yearly basis. This will keep the software company at check and they'll bring up new updates and functions as they'll want you to continue the services.\n\nAlso set aside a contingency budget of at least 15% to 20%. It is an important way to ensure that you have the budget and resources required to adapt to evolving project twists and turns.\n\n#### Way Forward\n\nWhile these 5 warnings can’t guarantee success, they can ensure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls or ERP disaster that many organizations succumb to. It is pretty clear from the above article that for SMEs the disadvantages of ERP outweigh the advantages.\n\nAlthough it’s worth checking over first as every business is different.

When a business grew to a certain point, the various software they used to run things became difficult to manage.\n\nFor example, they’d run separate software each for accounting, manufacturing, inventory, and customer resource management. It made sense for these businesses to graduate to an ERP to bring these together. But ERPs were born in a time when big corporations were the only players in the market. These companies could and still can make huge investments in servers, PCs, and networks. Additionally, ERPs were expensive to integrate and maintain.\n\nSo are they really worth it, speaking from point of view of an SME owner.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"erp_for_smes\" image=\"The-Top-5-Warning-Signs-of-An-ERP-Failure-1.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nTo answer this question we've made a detailed guide on ERPs and how useful they are/are not to SME businesses. We have made this guide after our experience discussing business problems with over 1000 SME owners in India.\n\n- **[What is ERP?](#intro)**\n- [**Advantages & Disadvantages of ERP**](#advantages_disadvantages)\n- [**What does your business need?**](#need)\n- **[Software selection Myths & Reality](#myths_reality)**\n- [**Is there a solution**?](#solution)\n- **[Conclusion](#conclusion)**\n\n## What is ERP\n\nERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. But what exactly does that mean?\n\n<blog-image alt=\"erp_for_smes\" image=\"erp-software-770x450-1.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\nERP refers to software that helps you run your entire business. It integrates the core processes of a company in one place. These processes include **finance, accounting, HR, sales, supply chain, services, and manufacturing** among others. The software generally functions in real-time. It uses a common database for all its actions. Varied computer hardware and network configurations run such systems. In easy words, an ERP is a type of management software.\n\n**Some examples of top ERP vendors in market are:**\n\n- **SAP**\\- Founded in 1972 by five former IBM engineers, SAP is the undisputed market leader in the ERP space and is the third-largest software company in the world. Its current version has more than 30,000 relational database tables that allow it to handle extremely complex business situations.\n- **Oracle**\\- Launched in 2004 Oracle was amongst the very first companies that provided ERP solutions. Oracle software is also a reliable product that can deal with huge database sizes and massive amounts of application workloads.\n- **SAGE Intacct:** Sage is also a popular ERP solution available in the ERP market. Gain real-time financial and operational visibility throughout your business. Leverage comprehensive financial controls to ensure security and compliance.\n\nAt some point, your business may outgrow the technology you used to manage your system from the start. A lot of businesses in your shoes try ERP when their accounting software and inventory spreadsheets become too difficult to manage. But well-versed research is always advised before making that commitment.\n\n## Advantages & Disadvantages of ERP\n\n#### The advantages presented by the ERP are:\n\n1. Optimization of business processes.\n2. Accurate and timely access to reliable information.\n3. The ability to share information between all components of the organization.\n4. Elimination of unnecessary operations and data.\n5. Reduction of time and costs of litigation.\n6. The performance of all work units that make up their business because better use time is increased. If you previously had to make reports and take them from one place to another, now the time is spent on other activities.\n7. To improve performance and save time, optimize the control and analysis of management decisions there in the long term, reduced costs for the company.\n8. Another obvious advantage is in terms of customer service because the response time is reduced attention to them.\n9. When a company has an ERP system is more competitive in the environment in which it operates.\n\n### Disadvantages presented by the ERP are:\n\n1. The installation of the ERP system is costly. ERP consultants are very expensive take approximately 60% of the budget.\n2. The success depends on the skills and experience of the workforce, including education and how to make the system work properly.\n3. Resistance in sharing internal information between departments can reduce the efficiency of the software.\n4. The systems can be difficult to use.\n5. Change of staff, companies can employ administrators who are not trained to manage the ERP system of the employing company, proposing changes in business practices that are not synchronized with the system.\n6. Your company may not need all the modules present in ERP, which makes it an unnecessary investment.\n7. The effectiveness of the ERP system may decrease if there is resistance to share information between business units or departments. Due to the strong changes that implementation of the ERP system brings in the culture of work, employees may be poorly trained or disinterested in making use of the same staff.\n8. The success of ERP mostly depends on the ability and skill of the workforce. You will have to spend a good time training your present workforce so that they use the system correctly.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"erp_for_smes\" image=\"1360176849.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\n##### Mind it that we aren't saying that ERP is evil and will tear your business apart.\n\nThere are a lot of success stories of ERP implementation too. This is where the size of your company comes into play. There is no doubt that there are differences in business processes and management between small & large companies. Small companies are usually multi-taskers, faster in reacting to change, flexible in their daily operations, and low on bureaucracy. But at the same time, this may be the first time that the company is thinking of going digital with its business procedures. Which makes the thought of implementation of complex ERPs into their system a bad idea.\n\nAt the same time, large companies usually need more routines in order to manage their business efficiently. The areas of responsibility amongst departments are divided clearly into large companies. Therefore they actually benefit from an integrated system. As for training, a big company has enough time and financial resources to train its employees. You can't say the same for small businesses. What we're trying to say here is that ERP is not meant for SMEs.\n\n**[Read More](/blogs/erp-implementation-failure-how-company-size-matters/) on how company size matters in ERP implementation**\n\nSo should SMEs not follow the path of digitisation at all.\n\nWell No. Here's what SME owners really need.\n\n**ERP Alternative = ERP - (Complications + Unnecessary modules+ Big Investment**)\n\n## What does your business need?\n\nWe kind of have an idea of what your business may be needing.\n\nYour business has outgrown the technology you are using currently to manage it. A lot of businesses in your shoes think of ERP when their accounting software and inventory spreadsheets become too difficult to manage. What they should understand though is that complex ERPs aren't the only option available. They should look for a more cost-effective, integrated, easier to use solution.\n\nIt's not a piece of news that ERPs are expensive. Most of them also have a one-time payment structure ie. you are supposed to make the investment even before your business is really streamlined.\n\n**[Read more](/blogs/erp-cost-key-points-to-consider-during-software-selection/) on ERP Cost and some key points to consider during software selection**\n\n<blog-image alt=\"erp_for_smes\" image=\"artical-image-man-using-laptop.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nTo understand what kind of solution you need, you need to firstly know the loopholes you are trying to fill with the solution.\n\n**Here are some really common challenges that SMEs face before they think of switching to ERP-**\n\n#### 1) **To Streamline Documentation Process**\n\nDocuments like invoices, legal contracts, proposals, transaction records, and other essential material, are high priority papers for all businesses. Missing even one of them can create a problem in the system So SMEs need a good document processing system to streamline their documentation processes.\n\n#### 2) Instant access to important information\n\nThis is one of those things that any small business owner, at least in my experience is looking for, especially at the time of pandemic while working with less staff. Something like a dashboard that can give immediate access to all of your important and critical business information, all in one place.\n\n#### 3) To take Data Driven decisions\n\nWhen money is already tight, it is always advised to make data-driven decisions in business. But SME owners mostly cannot find time because of other business processes or they don't know how they can analyze their data. So this is where they think of using technology to their business's rescue.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"download-6.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\n#### 4) To Optimize Payment collection process\n\nAccording to a study, 30% of payments made to small businesses are made late. There’s a culture in India of slow payment, which is bad news for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs highly rely heavily on prompt payment of invoices to meet their running costs and stay in a positive cash-flow position. Most SME owners wish that their payments are collected in a more effortless manner.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"due_bill\" image=\"203905-2120x1415-Past-Due-Envelope-1024x683.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\n#### 5) To solve Inventory Problems\n\nSME owners mostly know how inventory management is absolutely necessary to run an efficient business and to make money in the process. Still their inventory management process mostly face these issues\n\n- High cost of inventory\n- Consistent stockouts\n- High amount of obsolete inventory\n- High amount of working capital\n- Spreadsheet data-entry errors\n- Lost contacts of suppliers\n\nThus they want to solve these problems in their inventory management process.\n\nThus to solve the above problems SMEs think that ERP is the only solution that their business requires. What they don't realize is that ERPs are meant for bigger organizations. The requirement of business purely depends upon the size of the business Switching to a solution before defining requirements can prove to be a big disaster for your business\n\n## Software Selection: Myths & Reality\n\nThere are many things to take into consideration while making a decision to invest in any solution for business. Some of these selection criteria may be wrong for SMEs.Here is a list of these myths followed by a list of things to really consider while selecting a solution for businesses.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"uYYjZkg.png\"></blog-image>\n\n#### Myths\n\n#### **Myth 1- You can't go wrong with SAP or Oracle**\n\nBeing a small fish in a big pond is no fun!  \nTier One software companies like SAP and Oracle would like you to believe that choosing their solutions is the only safe company and career decision. This is not true. SAP and Oracle use system integrators to implement their systems. These companies may have no experience in your specific line of business. Also, most of the modules present in these ERPs may not be useful for your business at all. These solutions are also quite expensive and difficult to operate. Finding a solution with the functionality that supports your industry, out of the box, is key to a successful and on-budget implementation.\n\n#### **Myth 2: Understanding your Business needs is not necessary**\n\nWhy are you thinking of switching to an ERP? How many needs is ERP going to fulfill for your business? Are all ERP modules useful for your team? Will your team be able to switch to a complex ERP? Is there a better & affordable solution available? These are some questions you should know an answer for before switching to any solution.\n\n#### **Myths 3: All digital solutions are of same kind**\n\nThis is one of the most common myths that SME owners have towards digitisation. There are many solutions available in the market. Just like different businesses have different needs, there are different solutions that can cater your needs.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"shutterstock_430693420k-790x527-1.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nFor example a retail shop owner and a small manufacturing enterprise owner may both be thinking of digitizaton of their business processes, but both of them will have different needs thus different solution.\n\n### Things to keep in mind while making a decision\n\nWhile searching for digital solution, business owners should keep in mind the following things-\n\n- **Make a List Of Requirements-** Make a list of things that you want to benefit from any Software that you’ll be using. Make a list of requirements that your business has, the number of departments, and their necessities.\n- **Look at all the options-** There are numerous digital solutions in the market, therefore do not limit yourself with just the ones everyone else is using. Read their reviews find out what kind of companies should use which software.\n- **Professionalism-** The digital solution you will be opting for will act as a partner in your business as it will be taking part in the entire business. The right platform for your business should have solid customer support that will help you in on-boarding and will be available when you or your team faces any trouble.\n- **Intelligence-** All products are intelligent but not all of them share the same amount of intelligence. Examine the intelligence of the solutions that you have shortlisted and how far can it support the growth of your business.\n- **User Friendly-** Read and scrutinize deeply about its flexibility. When you purchase a product you would want to use it as fast as possible and hence make sure that it is user-friendly and your employees can adapt to it quickly.\n- **Budget-** . Budget is a factor you should consider while shortlisting software for selection as you cannot just go ahead with software that claims to be on the top of the market and have a shortage in the budget for your business.\n- **Free Trials/Demo-** The most important factor is taking a trial of the software. This makes everything easier for you. You can easily learn about the functions of a software when you actually use it and check on your own whether or not is it useful for your business.\n\nRead More - [Best ERP Sotwares to use in 2021](/blogs/best-erp-software-to-use-in-2021/)\n\n## Is There A Solution?\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"download-7.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\nWe know you are looking for a solution since you turned up to this article.

They are-\n\n- Finance\n- Procurement\n- Manufacturing\n- Inventory Management\n- Order Management\n- Warehouse Management\n- Supply Chain Management\n- Customer Relationship Management\n- Professional Services Automation\n- Workforce Management\n- Human Resources Management\n- Ecommerce\n- Marketing Automation\n\nAs good as all of these modules look, a lot of them may not be useful for SMEs. An SME usually doesn't have an HR department or a workforce management department. They also won't need marketing automation for a business their size. So a lot of what small businesses will pay for in an ERP will actually not be useful. This should be taken into consideration before making such a hefty investment.\n\n#### Budget\n\nThe average range of costs for the software and services associated with an ERP implementation is around 20 Lakhs. But that’s just the beginning. Annual software maintenance costs are usually in the ballpark of 20% of the initial license cost. This still doesn’t fully capture the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a typical ERP system.\n\nWhy are these costs so high? The reason is that ERP systems are designed to be comprehensive, one-size-fits-all platforms for running all aspects of a very large, often multinational corporation. Tailoring a gigantic industry-agnostic system to meet the specific needs of an SME is very costly and inefficient. Because of this level of customization, most ERP systems are failures for these kinds of companies. There is no reason to pay for functionality you don’t need and then spend additional money customizing and configuring that same system to accommodate how you do business when easier and cost-effective solutions are available.\n\n#### Time Taking\n\nSMEs have a small team of around 15-50 people. Thus all of the tasks are dependent on this team itself. When introduced to a new complicated system these employees may fall behind in the completion of their tasks, which can get a lot of unsatisfied clients and business losses. Thus upgrading to a complicated & rigid ERP system may not be a very good idea. Instead to digitize your business using a powerful but simple cloud-based product may be a good idea.\n\nRead More - [4 ERP Failure Stories and How to Not Be One](/blogs/4-erp-failure-stories-and-how-to-not-be-one/?utm_source=website%20internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ERP%20Implementation%20Failure%3A%20How%20company%20size%20matters)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIt is pretty clear from the above article that for SMEs the disadvantages of ERP outweigh the advantages. Although it’s worth checking over first as every business is different. Can you afford a complete software overhaul? Are your employees receptive to training? How long will it take before the long-term benefits outweigh the initial drawbacks? These are some of the questions you should know the answer to before ERP implementation. If you decide that you don't want to spend money on ERP, it doesn't mean you can digitize your business.

And for the tables and details which got previously filed and need changes will go under **AMEND RECORD DETAILS** section. With this new Re-arrangement feature, the users can easily navigate and ADD or Amend details in the FORM.\n- With the default manner every time, you go on the Dashboard, the **ADD RECORD DETAILS** section will be visible. But the **AMEND RECORD DETAILS** section will be hidden and collapsed. The taxpayers can expand it or collapse it as per their requirements. And this is done because observation got made that only 1% of the users amend the details. That is why it will be in collapsed mode.\n- The help buttons for the E-invoice advisory are on the top of the Dashboard for the user's ease.

If so, are you also constantly trying to make a plan and ensure that you have all the inputs ready for production. In this article, we'll try to summarize how you can optimize production process in your business using digital solution.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"How Can SMEs Optimize Production Process By Going Digital\" image=\"unnamed-1.jpeg\"></blog-image>\n\n[Production planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_planning) is all about sidestepping the puddles on the manufacturing road that tend to waste any team's valuable time and resources. By filling these voids in once and for all, you can streamline the whole process and make the production flow smoother. When the goal is to optimize production process, you should aim at improving things that can be improved easily. Then gradually you can move towards voids that may be a little tricky to fill.\n\nEasier said than done? The following guide highlights how a cloud-based integrated platform like [TranZact](/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=production_process_optimization) will help you optimize production process.\n\n#### Streamlining Inventory Management\n\nKeeping inventory is a major headache for every business. Occasional overstock causes unnecessary space shortage which causes a delay in fulfilling demand. Inventory management is the string of processes. It ensures that a manufacturing enterprise has the appropriate materials in the right quantity to complete the manufacturing process.\n\nRead More - [Inventory Management: Ultimate Guide for SMEs](/blogs/inventory-management-ultimate-guide-for-smes/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=How%20Can%20SMEs%20Optimize%20Production%20Process%20By%20Going%20Digital)\n\n#### How will a digital platform help\n\n**Centralized Inventory** - All the inventory data of the company will be incorporated in one system where all teams can easily access it and be in sync with each other. It will enable businesses to control their logistics, operations, finance, and inventory from a singular system reducing errors and improving efficiency.\n\n**Design (Bill of Materials)** - Using an ERP to create and manage your BOM makes procurement of parts easy. During the design phase, while your engineering department will be busy at work designing and engineering a new product, your procurement team will have easy access to the EBOM. Thus orders can be placed early, giving you time to get your hands on these parts before production begins. Also since everything is managed in one system it automatically links to inventory. Therefore the purchasing department always knows what is needed, and what is already sitting on your shelves, ready for production.\n\n**Minimum and Maximum Inventory Levels-** You can simply set limits that represent a maximum amount and minimum inventory amount. When your stock of a certain product reaches the minimum level the system will give you an alert to reorder. Also, you can’t order more than the maximum limit. This helps to optimize production process and makes it efficient.\n\n**Material Resource Planning** - Material requirements planning (MRP) is a planning and control system for inventory, production, and scheduling. Doing it in one platform synchronizes the flow of materials, components, and parts in a phased order system. It also combines and tracks hundreds of variables. For eg. Purchase orders, Sales orders, Shortage of materials, Due dates, Forecasts, Inventory, and Data.\n\nRead More - [6 ‘Must Haves’ Features For Your Inventory Software](/blogs/6-must-haves-features-for-your-inventory-software/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=How%20Can%20SMEs%20Optimize%20Production%20Process%20By%20Going%20Digital)\n\n#### Prepare Efficiently For Customer Demand\n\nIt is incredibly hard to be informed on what levels of inventory are required from one quarter of the year to the next when all data is tracked in a manual manner. The forecasting department can make an educated guess, which is based on the previous data they have. However, this may be prone to human error. It also won't take into account current changes in the market for the manufacturing business.\n\nDrawing inferences about customer trends in manual forecasting won't take into account how customer demands have changed. In that case, the results you will achieve via approximate guesses will be prone to error and less accurate.\n\n#### How will the ERP system help\n\n**Captures Shifts In Demand**\\- If you implement a digital solution in your business, the software will notify you about these shifts in customer demand using both previous and real-time data. This makes forecasting future customer demands very easy and effortless. Also, results are more accurate and reliable as opposed to employing manual methods.\n\n**Real-Time Data and Business Intelligence**\\- It offers built-in business intelligence (BI) features and reporting capabilities, Role-tailored dashboards, charts, and other visualizations. Also, it offers detailed reporting templates and streamlines data capture for analysis\n\n#### Effortless Communication with Customers and Suppliers\n\nMany SMEs operate on different software cobbled together that either overlap or produce a gap between functional areas.  As a result, communication does not take place at critical times for equally critical processes. The use of spreadsheets, repetitive data entry, and different units of measure from department to department can almost make it seem like the communication that does take place is being done using different “languages\".

This procedure repeats as it moves to the next department making it all cumbersome. This results in discouraging communication between teams. When teams are not able to communicate amongst themselves how will they be able to communicate well with customers?\n\n#### How can an ERP system help in effective communication?\n\n- **Unified Database**\\- One way a digital solution improves communication is by creating a single version of the truth.  Data is unified in a single database that is not specific to executives, or purchasing, or manufacturing.  The data is available to everyone in the team.  The unified database removes the need for different data implementation between departments and brings everyone under a common umbrella. This results in streamlining communication.\n- **All-Inclusive** – A second way that digital solutions can improve communication is that everyone is a part of the new platform Effective communication within an organization doesn't leave anyone out. Each functional area can communicate effectively because of data standardization.  It is no longer just a conversation between manufacturing and scheduling alone.  Now, **finance, inventory control, purchasing, supply chain, and executives can see the system in action and understand their place and functionality within the system**.  By including all departments in its core functionality and calculations, a manufacturing ERP system can help everyone feel like part of a unified team working in the same direction communication becomes more effective in this way.\n\nRead More - [ERP for SMEs?

How can India turn its latest growth upswing into a sustained rise in living standards and better jobs for its fast-growing labor force? The task is not easy. Very few countries have managed a successful transition from low- to middle- and then high-income status. South Korea is one of them — but it is a much smaller economy. In this article, we'll see how digitization in the manufacturing sector can help India grow.\n\n#### Digital industry can unlock tremendous value for India.\n\nIndia’s manufacturing sector needs to give a stronger contribution to economic growth and job creation. The Government of India recognizes this. Its [Make in India](http://www.makeinindia.com/) plan aims to increase the GDP share of manufacturing to 25% of GDP by 2025–30, from 17% currently. As a result it can create up to 90 million additional jobs.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"make-in-india-logo.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nThe two pillars of digital transformation in the industry are **innovation** and **disruption**. Companies must be attentive to the changing landscape of their industry. They should also be sure to count on the right talent in order to carry out new business models. Training should also be provided to retain the workforce.\n\nRead More - [5 Ways Digitization Can Optimize Your Company’s Profitability](/blogs/digitization-to-increase-profitability/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=How%20Digitization%20and%20Domestic%20Manufacturing%20Can%20Help%20India%20Grow)\n\n[Digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) is the application of digital capabilities to processes, products, and assets. This should in return enhance efficiency, increase customer value, manage risk and navigate through new revenue generation opportunities. This transformation is global and therefore involves adopting digital technologies for both internal operations and external ones. This including sales, marketing, and support efforts. Therefore, to adapt, companies must fundamentally change the way they operate. They should be willing to accept cultural change and rethink their present business methods.\n\n#### **Digital talent and capabilities are key to the transformation and exploitation of new business strategy.**\n\nAn [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) study confirms this by claiming that companies need limitless, adaptable humans to thrive in their ever-changing world. The study recommends companies stop viewing their applications, infrastructures, and employees as independent entities. To move on and see them as cross-cutting, and to consider them interconnected systems giving rise to the term industry 5.0.\n\nDigitization in the industry provides an opportunity to combine practices and ways of doing that result in new techniques, skills, and sources of income. Here are some of its key benefits:\n\n##### 1\\. Reduce Energy Usage\n\nDigitization of your firm can save you money beyond just by increasing productivity. Digital technology allows you to track your energy usage in real-time. Therefore, with this information, you can see what process uses the most energy. To sum up this gives you the chance to make changes and save money on energy costs in your facility. The result boosts your profits.\n\nRead More - [Digital Documentation: 5 Benefits for SMEs](/blogs/digital-documentation-5-benefits-for-smes/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=How%20Digitization%20and%20Domestic%20Manufacturing%20Can%20Help%20India%20Grow)\n\n##### 2\\. **Improve Communications With Suppliers**\n\nThrough real-time communications, you can find out where your supplies are at any given time. As a result, this improved supply chain information can help you better manage your operations. Improvements in supply chain management are especially clear in short-notice aspects of the system.\n\n##### 3\\. **Predict Maintenance**\n\nTo keep your facility up longer, predict when to conduct maintenance rather than reacting to breakdowns. Regular audits of processes will ensure everything is running smoothly. For example, A large chemical facility digitized its maintenance and saw an 80 percent drop in unexpected downtime.\n\n##### 4\\. **Raise Productivity**\n\nDigitization will definitely increase productivity of your team. Since work will be assigned already and all the discrepancies will also be known, the team will be better at its work.\n\n##### 5\\. **Increase Innovation**\n\nWith product development, you can increase innovation by cutting the time from development to deployment. Above all, using real-time data, product development can more rapidly meet changing demands. Even higher-tech data evaluation can predict when trends will change, similar to how predictive maintenance works. To sum up, meeting customer demands quickly can reduce the number of unsold products, lowering waste.\n\n##### 6\\. Boost Efficiency\n\nOperating a facility can be done from a centralized location. This is because it improves the ability of the business owners to see all lines and take control where needed. When working with a digital solution, a business owner can be everywhere in the plant at once. Thanks to controls at his or her fingertips, enacting decisions immediately is simple, cutting on downtime.\n\nRead More - [How Can SMEs Optimize Production Process By Going Digital](/blogs/how-can-smes-optimize-production-process-by-going-digital/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=How%20Digitization%20and%20Domestic%20Manufacturing%20Can%20Help%20India%20Grow)\n\n##### 7\\. **Make Your Storage Smarter**\n\nDigitizing makes your storage facilities smarter. This is to say that you can also make your warehouses and document storage centers more efficient and reliable. Inventory can also be managed more efficiently with no low or dead stocks as it'll be easier to track via a digital solution.\n\nRead More - [The Importance of Keeping an Accurate Inventory](/blogs/the-importance-of-keeping-an-accurate-inventory/?utm_source=Website%20Internal&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=How%20Digitization%20and%20Domestic%20Manufacturing%20Can%20Help%20India%20Grow)\n\n#### Way Forward\n\nDigitalization is reinventing businesses and capturing unique competitive advantages, but companies continue to hold back when the time comes to change their current business models. Digital transformation has been a kind of slogan for many top managers in recent years. According to a [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en) study, 79% of corporate strategists claim to be digitalizing their businesses to create new revenue streams. But so far change has been slow and less than half of the companies that claim to be transitioned bring their digital initiatives to the core of their strategy.\n\nThere are a lot of web solutions available for SMEs to digitize their business.

But there are still a lot of things, which your accounting software wont help you out with. Lets consider the following facts first.\n\n1. Do you have anyone to contact, if anything goes wrong?\n2. do you have someone to provide support to you if something goes off the track?\n3. If any error occurs, who would assist you regarding that?\n4. one of the most tedious task, about accounts, is reconciliation of the data, with your books of data with the final report. What if reconciliation goes not as per the plans?\n\nIf you try to answer the above questions, you would soon realize that no matter how much better your accounting software is, you would still have to face issues if you get stuck on something.

Many Accounting Softwares like [Tally](https://tallysolutions.com/) and [Busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78i2Do5SLVw) only require to install in the system and is then ready to use. Still, the process for its users in the organization is a little tricky. Firstly they have to learn about **\"How to use the software\"** and then get acquainted with it. So that is why it's a little tough to implement like any other new thing or system when used for the first time in the organization. And this process becomes a bit annoying. Generally, not many Big Accounting software companies provide On-Boarding customer support to all types of customers.

Even though after the onset of accounting softwares, it has become easier than earlier days. But if someone gets stuck with some complicated transactions, then you will have to consult your [CA](https://www.icai.org/).

Its good to have one, but its not enough certainly. I would rather vote for getting your business digitized instead of just relying upon the accounting softwares. Now if you are still in doubt, then let me clarify it in some more detail. To flourish your SME business, you would require to have as much digital technology as possible.

It's absolutely fine. Being resistant to any kind of change is a part of human nature. But change in business processes is something that is necessary with time in any organization.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Is Your SME Business Ready For A Digital Solution\" image=\"https___blogs-images.forbes.com_peterbendorsamuel_files_2019_07_GettyImages-1091738564-1200x887-1.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\nWe believe there are a few factors that you should consider before going forward with a digital solution for your business.\n\n#### 1\\. Excel Sheets Are Too Many And Too Long\n\nIf you need to make a list of anything, it’s tempting to see Excel may be your first resort. After all, it’s only a small list of items for yourself or a few close colleagues. What begins as a small project in Excel grows into something massive, at which point you could also face speed and stability issues or even a development problem you can’t solve.\n\nFurthermore, [big data management](https://hbr.org/2012/10/big-data-the-management-revolution) tasks often present significant challenges, such as organization, implementation, classification of files, database management, user collaboration, and more. In conclusion, All it takes to break the structure of a database is placing data in the wrong area, typing data inconsistently, or even having two people working on the same sheet. Several things can go wrong, causing time delays and possible data loss. So this something that really should be avoided in business and you should move forward with a digital solution in your business.\n\nRead More - [6 Reasons Why Excel Doesn’t Work For Inventory Management](/blogs/6-reasons-why-excel-doesnt-work-for-inventory-management/?utm_source=website%20internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Is%20Your%20SME%20Business%20Ready%20For%20A%20Digital%20Solution)\n\n#### 2\\. Communication gap between employees\n\nWith the onset of pandemic, 'how to communicate' has become one of the biggest problems in any SME manufacturing company. Meanwhile you just can't seem to find a way to collaborate with your employees or look after what they are doing working remotely. This is where a digital solution comes to your rescue. Through a digital solution you can-\n\n- Automate routine customer-related tasks and process of returns\n- Offer 24 x 7 customer self-service support\n- Access to order history, delivery status, etc. to everyone\n- Unifiy the data by providing a centralized data repository\n- Draws information from suppliers and clients\n- Take better data-backed decisions\n\n#### 3\\. Running out of inventory\n\nWhen you have less customers and less products keeping a track of inventory using Excel sheets is good. But when you have a lot of products and a lot of inventory moving in and out you should look for something that can automate the tedious data entry process. Therefore this is exactly what a digital solution will do. Here is how digital inventory management solution will do\n\n- **Planning replenishment orders:** Inventory management allows you to properly plan your replenishment orders. Your inventory quantity must be accurate so when the signal to buy or make more is received. An inventory management system allows you to categorize parts which help easily order the right quantity. Your goal here is fewer transactions so you order enough to satisfy all the demands seen in the next few months.\n- **Surplus inventory management**: You can quickly see and react to surplus inventory. Should you return the item? Can you contact the customer and ask for another order to use up the surplus?\n- **Business Savings:** You save time and money through better inventory organization using your digital inventory management system. Better organization can lead to improved customer satisfaction.\n\nRead More - [The Importance of Keeping an Accurate Inventory](/blogs/the-importance-of-keeping-an-accurate-inventory/?utm_source=website%20internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Is%20Your%20SME%20Business%20Ready%20For%20A%20Digital%20Solution)\n\n#### 4\\. **Difficultly in maintaining cashflow because of late payments**\n\nDo you forget to track down customers for their due payments? Tracking down customers for payments is one tricky job. You can lose track of pending payments as more and more come along. A digital solution will never let you forget a pending payment and you can easily share invoices with your customers through emails or WhatsApp. Tracking down also becomes a lot easier because all the orders can be viewed sorted by time and date.\n\nRead More - [Digital India: Why Businesses should Go Digital?](/blogs/digital-india-why-businesses-should-go-digital/?utm_source=website%20internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Is%20Your%20SME%20Business%20Ready%20For%20A%20Digital%20Solution)\n\n#### Way Forward\n\nDigitalization is reinventing businesses and capturing unique competitive advantages, but companies continue to hold back when the time comes to change their current business models.

And in some occasions, there were observations like no written Purchase Order was present just, Verbal Communication over a phone call was enough.\n\nThis type of behavior in the organization created confusion for both sides of buyers and suppliers. So after incurring some losses in the business, SMEs tend to understand why making Purchase Order is essential for the proper functioning of their companies. And from then, the use of Purchase Orders is seen a lot in SMEs.\n\nSo now, if you have come to this article, you want to know about the problems small businesses face with Purchase Order. And before going to talk about let's understand what exactly a Purchase Order means.\n\n## What is Purchase Order?\n\nPurchase Order (PO) is a commercial document made by a Buyer to present the first official offer to the Seller that they want to place an order with the vendors or suppliers of a product and services.\n\nThe PO contains a purchase request and the product-related details such as the types of goods, quantity, price, and other terms & conditions which are essential for the transaction. In the absence of a contract between the Buyer and Supplier, the Purchase Order serves as a valid contract when the Vendor gives a proper acceptance to the Purchase Order.\n\nSo after understanding what the PO or Purchase Order means. Let's find out the problems which SMEs face with regards to POs.\n\n## Problems which SMEs face with Purchase Orders?\n\nGenerally, SMEs and manufacturing concerns make their purchase orders manually on paper or sometimes use Excel. And this behavior of businesses of not automating themselves becomes the biggest problem for them. So the Problems which SMEs with Purchase Orders when prepared manually are as follows:-\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Purchase Order in Excel\" image=\"PURCHASE-ORDER-IN-EXCEL-1-1024x1024.jpg\"></blog-image>\n\n###### 1\\. **No Streamlining of POs is possible** \n\nThe PO's, if made manually on paper or Excel, it becomes a little hectic process to follow the Purchase Flow procedures within the organization. Taking the approvals of the person in charge for authorizing the PO within the company will require an extra effort from the person preparing it as he has to send it for approval through mails. And this is an example of an unnecessary step in the Purchase Flow. \n\n###### 2\\. **Communication Gap problem**\n\nIf SMEs make POs manually, they have to send the document to all the parties concerned in the department series of separate emails to inform them about it. And if one department may not get the intimation about it due to some mistake, then the whole business might suffer because of lack of communication among departments. To give a glimpse of what problem SMEs might face, let's take an example of the Finance department when it didn't receive any news about a new Purchase order. So then, the company will be ill-prepared for this purchase and may lack funds to pay for it. And this will create a crisis for the business. So due to this, there is a need to automate the core business activities.\n\n###### 3\\. **No Tracking of POs is possible** \n\nIf SMEs make their POs on Excel and paper, effortless Tracking becomes a big problem. As there is no mechanism to track the different POs with different PO numbers on Excel in one place. So SMEs cannot track and analyze the information of how many POs got sent and what products in how much quantity got ordered. And this directly affects the decision-making process of the management authorities of companies.\n\n###### **4\\. Reminder problems about Delivery dates**\n\n SMEs face the problem of not getting any updates regarding the delivery date mentioned in the POs when they use Excel for making POs. And this piece of information is helpful for them. As through it, they can coordinate with the suppliers if they have dispatched the products on time or not. And also, can make preparations for the delivery in their warehouses.\n\nRead More about - [6 Reasons Why Excel Doesn’t Work For Inventory Management](/blogs/6-reasons-why-excel-doesnt-work-for-inventory-management/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Problems+of+SMEs+with+Purchase+Order)\n\n## Way Forward\n\nThe problems that SMEs are facing with Purchase orders are pretty much the same for every different type of business.

In such uncertain times of growing pandemic situation, we need to focus more on improving the cash-flow in SMEs. In this article, I would try to describe **7 effective ways to maintain and enhance great cash-flow.**\n\n### 1\\. **Take rent, instead of buying** for your SME.\n\nWhen you take on rent for your business use, then you pay small amounts on a monthly basis. This helps to keep the debt to profit ratio in a healthy state. If you buy anything, then certainly you would have to initially invest a lot of amount into it, then your debt may rise if you don’t earn significant profit in the upcoming business cycles. So, in taking up rent, its significantly less riskier than buying anything. Apart from this, when you buy something, may be you would end up paying [property tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax) or [wealth tax,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax) on the other hand, while you are using something on rent, you will be exempted from paying taxes, because lease payments are a business expense, and thereby can be written off on your taxes.\n\n### 2\\. **Offer discounts for those who pay early to you**\n\nThis is a very effective way to maintain good cash flow in SMEs. If the customer gets attracted to better offers while he clears his dues earlier than expected, then it’s a win -win situation. Both the parties are at gain.\n\n### 3\\. **Conduct a credit check for customers whose payment mode is not cash**\\-\n\nSo this is very much important for those customers, who takes credit from you. You need to check their [credit score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score) before lending them the product. If the [credit score](https://www.bankbazaar.com/credit-score.html) is not up-to the mark, then be sire, there is a high chance that he won’t be paying you up within the permissible deadline.\n\n### 4\\. **Try to create a buyer’s association for your SME to get discounted price**\\-\n\nSo, almost all the suppliers will offer a discounted price, if you order your supplies in bulk. Then, you need to find more guys, who are ready to purchase the same category products like you, so that, you can place bulk orders each time with the suppliers. You can share the discounted price with your peer buyers group. This helps you to pay the suppliers less, and hence in-turn raises your revenue of the company. So cash-flow for SME is impacted positively.\n\n### 4\\. **Improve your inventory**\\-\n\nThis is very much necessary to have a healthy cashflow in SMEs. You need to get rid of the products which are no more in demand, and get rid of all such suppliers. No point in getting those things supplied to your warehouse where you won’t be able to clear off the stock to the buyers. In this particular scenario, we have to think rationally and not emotionally. Unnecessarily putting a lot of money to the things less in demand, will raise your debts and impact the cash flow in an adverse manner.\n\nRead More - [Lessons from COVID-19: 4 inventory management strategies](/blogs/lessons-from-covid-19-4-inventory-management-strategies/?utm_source=website%20internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Ways%20To%20Improve%20Cashflow%20In%20SMEs%20During%20Pandemic)\n\n### 5\\. **Have a provision of late payment fees from clients who regularly default the payments**\\-\n\nSo, out of 10 clients let’s say, there would be 1 or 2 people, who would regularly default the payments and they are reluctant to change this habit. In such situation, the best way to save the cashflow is to introduce a late payment system. It can ensure that there would be a disciplined way of transaction between the supplier and the buyer. This would help in dealing with the cashflow crisis of SME, if arises.\n\n### 6\\. **Use electronic payment systems for better cashflow management** - \n\nLast but not the least, this point can effectively impact your cashflow with the clients. Using electronic mode of payment can help in a lot of ways, including better time management, better efficiency and better handling of money. Ever since the technology has evolved, the cashflow management process an SME has become very easy and smooth. Also, we can say that, using electronic media, will reduce the hectic process of handling accounts into a process that could be handled by anyone, anywhere.

For instance, you can use, current account with high interest rates, to increase the cashflow. Check with the current rates of interest in various banks, to choose the best among them.

And much other stuff related to the product creation process. But do you have noticed about what is the first step taken into the production planning process? It's the creation of the Bill of Materials (BOM) document. Without BOM, you cannot estimate anything about production like raw materials quantity, other resources requirement, cost of production, profit estimation, etc.\n\nNow to clear the doubts of my readers about this blog. It will answer all your questions about the Bill of Materials (BOM), its usage, meaning, the different types, and many other exciting things.\n\n## What is Bill of Materials (BOM)?\n\nBefore going to a standard definition, let's understand the BOM with an example. Suppose you want to make a particular favorite food item say a Pizza. Then to make that Pizza, you will need a list of ingredients for collecting them before going for cooking. And after you got all your ingredients, you will need an instruction manual to guide you with the cooking process. So, after all of that, your final product will get ready.\n\nThe Bill of Materials (BOM) is an exhaustive list document that tells about all the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, and information required to manufacture a finished product. The BOM provides all the relevant information like the quantity, quality, shape, size, and others for the production process. The bill of material serves as a communication medium between multiple manufacturing partners and a single manufacturing plant.\n\n## Why is a Bill of Material (BOM) needed?\n\nIt is the same question as to why we need a cooking guide for making our favorite Pizza? You may not be knowing the ingredients, methodology as to how to cook it, and that is the reason for using the cooking guidebook.\n\nSo same reason goes with BOM people who are actually working in the production process may not have a complete idea about the whole process. And if they, by their own judgment, change any component in the manufacturing process, it may go haywire.\n\nAlso, the top management cannot easily understand the manufacturing process requirements because they are not working on it directly, and they will need a standard document to understand it. So these are some common reasons where the BOM's presence is necessary. Now let's look into some detailed reasons where BOM helps a business out.\n\n[<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"1.png\"></blog-image>](?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+Bill+of+Materials+-+Everything+you+should+know+about+BOM)\n\n[<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"2.png\"></blog-image>](?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+Bill+of+Materials+-+Everything+you+should+know+about+BOM)\n\n##### Material Purchase Planning\n\nBOM makes clear what all raw materials, resources, and steps, requirements are present in the organization. And accordingly, the quantity requirement is also there. On the basis of these pieces of information, the raw material procurement process becomes easy.\n\n##### Cost Estimation\n\nWith the help of BOM total quantity and proportion of raw materials required for a particular product gets known. And that is how if we want to calculate the cost of production, it can get done. Further, the management can make decisions based on this cost estimates data and plan the future working model.\n\n##### Inventory Control\n\nBOM gives organizations ideas about raw material and other resources consumption. And that's how they project their short and long-term manufacturing plans. Accordingly, using up their working capitals and controlling their inventory needs. Further, they can quickly determine if there is any problem with the inventory consumptions due to discrepancies.\n\nRead more about - [Inventory Control: Six Best Techniques To Follow](/blogs/inventory-control-6-best-techniques-to-follow/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+Bill+of+Materials+-+Everything+you+should+know+about+BOM)\n\n##### Material Requirement Planning (MRP) & Tracking\n\nBOM is one of the first steps in the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) process, essential to all manufacturing concerns.

Further, they can easily track everything like whether raw materials reached the warehouse or not, stock levels are sufficient or not, and if there is some additional need of resources or not. And this all goes on continuously because of the Bill of Materials.\n\n##### Maintaining Cashflow\n\nWith the help of BOM and the organization's plans, the requirement of working capital will get anticipated. Accordingly, the company will know how to manage their cash inflows and cash outflows to pay for their inputs needs. Further, they can put aside some additional funds for specific months where the procurement quantity will increase on the basis of BOM's material proportions.\n\nRead more about - [Ways To Improve Cashflow In SMEs During Pandemic](/blogs/ways-to-improve-cashflow-in-smes-during-pandemic/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+Bill+of+Materials+-+Everything+you+should+know+about+BOM)\n\n##### Vendor Selection\n\nBill of Materials specifies the quality and different other specific information for product preparation.

But majorly, there are only two kinds of BOMs that are differentiated on the basis of their structure. Let's discuss them further.\n\n###### 1\\. ****Single-level BOM (Bill of Materials) -**** \n\nAs the name suggests, is the single-level bill of material that shows the components required to create either one assembly or sub-assembly.\n\nThe meaning of assembly is the final products that can be sold and used directly. The sub-assembly is the finished product that can become input for other manufacturing processes.\n\nThis BOM is used directly in production lines to ease out the understanding of the whole process.\n\n###### **2\\. Multi-level BOM (Bill of Materials)** **\\-**\n\nThe Multi-level BOM has one more name of Indent BOM. So this particular structure BOM helps in showing the relationship between components, sub-assemblies, and main assembly. This relationship has two other titles of Parent-Child and Top-Down methods.\n\nThis BOM is of [hierarchical nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), in which the top-level shows a sub-assembly that is one of the main components of the assembly. And how other sub-assemblies, when put together, creates the final product. \n\nThe Multi-level BOM can have both single and multi-level BOMs of sub-assemblies and their own sub-assemblies. Accordingly, the Multi-level BOM helps to break down the process of building up a final product that will have an ultimate use for consumption of any kind.\n\n## How to make a Bill of Material?\n\nFrom all the above discussions, you all can understand what BOM is, what it does, and what are its two types. And that's why you are wondering how to implement it in your own organization. So to solve this problem, you can use any automation software to create a BOM.\n\nBut before that, you should break down all the components and procedures used to create your main final product. Accordingly, you will get to know about all the components that whether you will procure them from somewhere else or will manufacture them. Further, you will decide about the person who will create it and can add revisions to it. Then you will decide about the structure of BOM if it will be single or multi-level. And after that, you will start listing it with the help of a software solution.\n\n## Way Foward\n\nNow, if you are implementing the usage of BOM in your organization. Then I think you are doing it to maintain clear communication and better understanding between different departments. And also to collect and track data and learnings using which you can make efficient key decisions for your firm.\n\nSo these all things can only become useful to you only with a digital solution. Because if you will prepare the BOM manually, then the purpose of it will become faulty, and other things will suffer.\n\nSo it is advisable to use automation software for the preparation of BOM and other business activities.

And these processes are essential for their smooth operations. Because these companies have various departments working and they all work in coordination with each other. So, if one of the processes gets not done, it could affect their operating activities. Let's talk about the procurement process as it's one of the core activities. If the **Delivery Note** and **Goods Received Note (GRN)** is not perfect, or the employees are not preparing them. Then the communication will get a severe effect between the departments.\n\nBefore going into more detail about the usage of GRN and how it is essential for the procurement process, let's understand what it is.\n\n## What is Goods Received Note (GRN)?\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWxUPO00L0Q?feature=oembed\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" />\n\nThe **GRN (or Goods Received Note)** is a **2-way document** that verifies that the supplier has delivered the product to the recipient. And this procurement of goods is taking place because of the buyer's Purchase Order.\n\nFurther, this document serves as proof that the supplier has fulfilled his obligation as per the agreement with its customer.\n\nAdditionally, the meaning that GRN has for the buyers is that it also acts as a quality checking document that verifies their purchases. It confirms that the procurement is happening for the specific quality of products.\n\nAlso, it serves as a communication medium between the various departments regarding the purchases.\n\n## How do the GRNs help the businesses?\n\nThe Goods Received Note helps the businesses in managing their crucial processes, and these are some of the ways how it is necessary for them -\n\n#### 1\\. **Product Verifying document.**\n\nThis GRN document alone helps verify the quantity and quality of goods for which the procurement process is happening in the organization.\n\nAs on the gates of the warehouse, when the supplier delivers the goods, there is no staff available who has given the specific order and can check these items.\n\nSo, to verify these goods at the warehouse gate point, only the warehouse staff matches the goods with the **[Purchase Orders (PO's)](/blogs/problems-of-smes-with-purchase-order/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+What+is+Goods+Received+Note+%28GRN%29+-+Ultimate+Guide+for+SMEs&utm_campaign=What+is+Goods+Received+Note+%28GRN%29+-+Ultimate+Guide+for+SMEs)** and the GRNs.\n\nAnd if only the products match with the description in these documents.

As the earlier [Indirect Tax regime](https://www.investindia.gov.in/taxation) was a little bit tough for the taxpayers to operate with it. And since GST's commencement in 2017, the GST Council and the Government are taking many steps to make this tax regime burden-free for taxpayers. The measures like GST E-Invoicing, E-way Bills, and [Quarterly filings](https://cleartax.in/s/quarterly-return-monthly-payment-qrmp-scheme-gst) for SMEs with respective turnovers are of great help. And one of the Government's initiatives is to provide accounting and billing software to small businesses with a turnover of less than **Rs.5 crores** for free to help them in GST Invoice preparations, Return filing, and accounting needs.\n\nSo you all know that GST Invoice and E-Invoicing are some necessary things for businesses. Now let's discuss them and what problems SMEs face with them.\n\n## What is a GST Invoice?\n\nGST Invoice is a commercial document, invoice, or bill showing the details of goods or services offered by the seller to the buyer, which comprises quantity, cost, and tax amount-related information. It's the same as other invoices that businesses were using before the GST Act implementation. \n\n## What is GST E-Invoicing?\n\nGST E-Invoicing is a tool through which electronic authentication of pre-generated GST Invoice, which is uploaded on [Invoice Registration Portal (IRP)](https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in/), is done by the GST department. The E-Invoicing does not involve new Invoices preparation on any Government portal that generates them electronically. But it involves the old GST invoices generated by any software or other utility which businesses use to be uploaded on IRP Portal.\n\nThe purpose of uploading invoices on the IRP portal is to get a report on details of Business to Business (B2B) and export invoices. Through the IRP portal upload action, invoices get a unique identification number for every invoice called Invoice Reference Number (IRN). Further, invoices get digitally signed QR codes which provides a standardized look to all invoices generated by different businesses. GST E-Invoicing is only applicable to those taxpayers' companies with **Rs.50 Crores** and **above** [](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/51_GST_Flyer_Chapter7.pdf;jsessionid=2DC4B9AEA6EA9820EE5F2E595F0EB886) **[aggregate turnover](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/51_GST_Flyer_Chapter7.pdf;jsessionid=2DC4B9AEA6EA9820EE5F2E595F0EB886).**  \n\n<blog-image alt=\"GST Invoicing & E-Invoicing\" image=\"Benefits-of-E-Invoicing-1024x1024.png\"></blog-image>\n\nBenefits of GST E-Invoicing\n\nIn the 37th meeting of the [GST Council](http://www.gstcouncil.gov.in/), they introduced the concept of Electronic invoice or E-invoice for GST taxpayers. The purpose behind this step is to curb fake invoicing. Tax leakage and fraud by using Fake invoices were a concern of the Government much before the GST law introduction.\n\nRead More about - [The Ins and Outs Of GST Filing](/blogs/the-ins-and-outs-of-gst-filing/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+GST+Invoice+%26+GST+E-Invoicing-5+Problems+SMEs+face%3F)\n\n## Problems SMEs face with GST Invoice and E-Invoicing.\n\nNow after, knowing about GST Invoice and E-Invoicing, that is what it meant. Let's understand what problems all businesses face with them.\n\n##### 1\\. GST Bill Format Issues.\n\nIt is one of the issues that small businesses face when managing their business operations manually. So SME owners many times are seen to use Excel or traditional methods of pre-printed paper-based invoices. And then this problem arises because they don't know what details go in the invoice and are also unable to design it.\n\nSo the answer to their first problem with regards to details of the information that goes in GST Invoices are as follows - \n\n- Invoice number and Date.\n- Customer name.\n- Customer and Taxpayers GSTIN (if registered).\\*\n- Shipping and billing address.\n- Place of supply.\n- [HSN code](https://cleartax.in/s/gst-hsn-lookup)/ SAC code.\n- Item details like description, quantity, unit (meter, kg, etc.), total value.\n- Taxable value and discounts.\n- [Rate](https://cleartax.in/s/gst-rates/) and amount of taxes of CGST/ SGST/ IGST.\n- Whether GST is payable on a reverse charge basis.\n- Signature of the supplier.\n\n\\*If the recipient is not registered and the value is more than **Rs. 50,000** then the invoice should carry:\n\n1. Name and Address of the Recipient.\n2. Address of delivery.\n3. State name and code.\n\nAnd for the second problem of professional GST Invoice design and other issues, the business should digitize themselves using a software solution. Because by adopting the software for their business operations, SMEs should not worry about Invoice format problems. As the software will provide for it. And it will reduce the chance of any Human Error which was coming when invoices got generated in Excel or other manual forms.\n\n##### 2\\. Customer's GSTIN Verification.\n\nLike the first problem, this one also arises when businesses perform their invoicing activity manually or on Excel. There is no method of matching the GSTIN of the recipient with the GST Portal's database on Excel. And that's why if the wrong GSTIN gets a mention on the bill, it can also affect the GST Returns. Also, the recipient will not get the Input Tax Credit on its purchase.\n\nSo this problem is only happening because of one issue that is all business processes are conducted manually. And the solution to it is that companies should automate and digitalize their whole business activities. For this problem companies, can use business management software solutions enabled with GST features. And then, organizations can automatically verify their customers' GSTIN while entering their details in the software only.\n\n##### 3\\. HSN Code and GST Rate determination.\n\nThe subsequent problem businesses face determining that in which [HSN code category](https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchhsnsac) does their product falls. And also with the regular change in GST rates on products and services which one applies to them.\n\nSo like the other problems, if businesses use software solutions, then this can get solve efficiently. As these software solutions get new updates regularly, which carry the current GST Rates changes. And also with large data backups on [HSN Codes](https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchhsnsac) and Chapters help businesses identifying their particular [HSN categories](https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchhsnsac).\n\n##### 4\\. Sorting B2B and B2C Invoices.\n\nThe GST E-Invoicing is only applicable to Business to Business (B2B) transactions of the registered taxpayers and not to Business to Consumer (B2C) transactions. So companies need to know and sort all the B2B transactions separately for IRP portal uploading purposes. And if the firms are maintaining them manually on Excel, then the process becomes complex and lengthy prone to errors.\n\n<blog-image alt=\"\" image=\"e-invoicing-solution-using-SAP.png\"></blog-image>\n\nSo like the other problems, the solution to this one is also the same. Companies should use software to automate their core business activities. And with this automation process, the invoicing process will also get digitalized. And then, the sorting and selection of B2B invoices will become easy and error-free.\n\n##### 5\\. Reconciliation of GST E-Invoices\n\nThe main problem is with the matching of E-Invoice data and E-way bill data with GSTR-1 B2B transaction data. That all these data match with each other, and there are no discrepancies.\n\nThis reconciliation process, if done manually for massive data, becomes a difficult task. And if the ERPs or Business management solution has integration with IRP/GSP/ASP data, this process becomes a lot easier for SMEs.\n\n## Way Forward\n\nSo from the problem statement above, it is clear that SMEs principally face the problem with GST Invoicing and E-Invoicing because of its manual style of working. And the solution for this problem is only when the business will digitize their core business activities using suitable software.\n\nRead More about - [4 Facts and Challenges SMEs should know about Purchase Order](/blogs/problems-of-smes-with-purchase-order/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=What+is+GST+Invoice+%26+GST+E-Invoicing-5+Problems+SMEs+face%3F)\n\nThe companies should choose a software solution which is best for them and satisfies all their needs.

So to work out the Supplier Relationship Management process, there are around 3 steps involved -\n\n1. **[Supplier Segmentation Procedure:](https://www.prokuria.com/post/how-to-perform-supplier-segmentation)** In this step, businesses take the help of a tool or software to analyze the data related to a supplier. So to select vendors based on pre-defined criteria and put them in specific categories, analogous to the Supplier Rating process. Through this Segmentation, process companies differentiate their suppliers to identify opportunities and risks related to them.\n2. **Strategy Development Procedure:** In this step, organizations based on data-driven facts and reports devise action plans and strategies to interact with suppliers. It's done to maintain a positive relationship with vendors as they will help satisfy their businesses' requirements both in positive and critical times.\n3. **Strategy Execution Procedure:** In this last step, businesses execute all plans and strategies develop in earlier stages in the best possible way. To achieve the desired results and objectives for the company.\n\n## What does everyone mean by Supplier Rating?\n\nSupplier Rating or Vendor Rating is a simple process of establishing performance categories for ranking the suppliers/vendors based on several factors such as their credibility, Delivery Time, Price, and the Quality of products they offer. Through the rating process, a collection of reliable data related to suppliers will be maintained. And it will help businesses analyze this data and make important decisions about choosing the right supplier for their particular requirements in different scenarios.\n\n## Why are both Supplier Rating and Supplier Relationship Management needed?\n\nAs we have explained about the concepts of the Supplier Rating and Supplier Relationship Management above. You all might have got an idea about Supplier Rating that it's an activity in the Supplier Relationship Management process. As it comes to the first stage of SRM, which is the [Supplier Segmentation](https://www.prokuria.com/post/how-to-perform-supplier-segmentation) because it deals with supplier evaluation.\n\nSupplier Rating ensures that suppliers provide their products as per set standards based on their previous dealings and buyers' requirements. Also, it helps through the supplier evaluation process to identify the weak areas of suppliers. Like where they lack in meeting your businesses' requirements. And through Supplier Rating, only a criterion is set based on which comparison between different suppliers can be performed. All these things contribute to providing a perfect data analysis for the owners and top management of any business. And they will use it to make the best decisions for their organization in selecting the suppliers on whom they can rely in critical times. So that is the reason why Supplier Rating is so necessary. And why it deserves the same level of importance as the Supplier Relationship Management concept.\n\nSupplier Relationship Management helps in making strategies to exploit the supplier's capabilities in the best possible way. And it ensures that the supply chain continues without any difficulty and without bearing up any additional costs. Further, this relationship-building up process with vendors increases their response rate. Also, it provides visibility into future prices and hedges against price volatility. And that is why Supplier Relationship Management is necessary for businesses.\n\n## Techniques for setting up Supplier Rating standards.\n\nNow let's end wait for you all as we have told you all about Supplier Rating and Supplier Relationship Management. What both mean, why both are important, and how they link to each other. The next thing you all want to know and why you came to this article is the various techniques for setting up the standards based on which Supplier Rating is done. So here are these specific techniques-\n\n<blog-image alt=\"Supplier Relationship Management & Supplier Rating Criteria\" image=\"image.png\"></blog-image>\n\nSupplier Rating Criteria\n\n###### 1\\. Weighted Point Plan -\n\nIt is a supplier selection approach that enables the purchaser to evaluate them. In this plan, the buyer assigns weights to each evaluation category (Quality, delivery, or service, and price) for each supplier, and a weighted sum for each of them is obtained. Then a comparison is made. The weights used should sum to 100% for all categories.\n\n###### 2\\. Cost Ratio Plan -\n\nIn this plan, the buyer calculates a cost ratio for each different supplier, and on that basis, the buyer ranks them. The ranking is done on various variables like quality, price, timely delivery. And on these data, calculation of cost ratio in percentage is done. Based on the total individual cost and the total value of the purchase.\n\n###### 3\\. Service Cost Ratio -\n\nMany intangible aspects of a supplier's services are there for which subjectively measuring is done. So the things to consider for measuring supplier service capabilities are Labour stability, financial stability, flexibility in production for rush orders, research, and development (R&D). And based on these criteria weight, is assigned to them. Then the Weight Point Plans steps are followed similarly.\n\n###### 4\\. Forced Decision Matrix -\n\nAt first, in this plan, different attributes like the lead time of supply, vendor reliability, quality, service, and price get identified. Accordingly, a comparison between all these factors takes place. Then a weight to a particular attribute is given, and the other is set to zero. And then the evaluation of suppliers is done.\n\n###### 5\\. Eavastons's Vendor Selection -\n\nIn this plan, previous performances of the vendor are considered for choosing them. And the ranking process takes place based on the buyers' subjective evaluation.\n\n###### 6\\. [Carter's 10 C's Model -](https://www.10cmodelsupplierselection.com/about-the-creator-of-the-10c-model/)\n\nIt is a criterion for assessing the suitability of a potential supplier. The buyer uses this as a checklist when deciding who to approach and who to avoid. The list includes factors competency, capacity, commitment, control, cash, cost, consistency, culture, cleanliness, communication.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter learning about the techniques of supplier rating standards, the other thing you all need to know is that manually Supplier Rating is not possible. What we mean to say is that a business performing all its core business activities on paper manually. It cannot implement this process in its organization. Because it requires a large amount of collection of data and proper analysis of it. And it is only possible when a business is digitalized.\n\nFor an enterprise to go digital involves the help of a software solution. And there are many solutions available in the market which can help businesses to go digital. But they should choose among the best option which satisfies all their needs.

It is that stage when their customers approach them with an inquiry about the products they offer. It comes in between the steps of **Prospecting** and **Connecting Qualifying leads** of the Sales Cycle. \n\n## What does Sales Quotation mean?\n\nThe term Sales Quotation is also a stage in the Sales flow of a business. A quotation is a type of document which helps the prospective customer determine the cost of products. It is generally prepared based on Customer Inquiries received by the businesses. It comes in the **Presenting of an Offer** step of the Sales Cycle. \n\nNow after knowing about the terms Customer Inquiry and Sales Quotation meaning.

According to this update, the taxpayers are getting relief from the **[Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC)](https://www.cbic.gov.in/)**.\n\nNow you all may be questioning what this update headline is?\n\nSo, here it is on 23rd November 2021.

In the case of closure or discontinuation of the registered business.\n2. In the case of change in the constitution of business resulting into the change of [PAN](https://www.pan.utiitsl.com/).\n3. The registered person is not liable to pay tax under GST.\n4. The registered person is not required to register under GST.\n5. In the case when after obtaining voluntary registration, the registered person didn’t commence the business within the stipulated time.\n6. In the case of Transfer of business on account of **[Amalgamation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amalgamation.asp)** or **[De-Merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demerger.asp#:~:text=A%20de%2Dmerger%20(or%20%22,separate%20legal%20entities%20to%20handle)** or **Sale**.\n\nRead More about - [What is GST Invoice & GST E-Invoicing-5 Problems SMEs face?](/blogs/what-is-gst-invoice-gst-e-invoicing-5-problems-smes-face/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog+-+Withdrawl+of+Cancellation+Application+of+GST+Registration+under+REG-16&utm_campaign=Withdrawl+of+Cancellation+Application+of+GST+Registration+under+REG-16)\n\nSo, if the registered person qualifies for any of these conditions, then, they can file for the cancellation electronically through the GST portal. Further, the proper GST Officer will process the application if found accurate. Then, the proper officer will issue a cancellation order in **Form GST REG-16**. According to the GST Act, the GST Officials have to issue the cancellation order in **30 days** from the **date of filing of the application**.\n\n## Withdrawal of Application for Cancellation of GST Registration.\n\nSo as per the new notification of CBIC on GST Portal, the registrants can now withdraw their application of Cancellation of GST Registration through Form REG-16. But the only condition here to satisfy is that the GST Officials have not taken any action on the Application form.\n\nTherefore, before applying for the withdrawal of application the Registrants may have to track the status of the cancellation application.\n\nSo, to help you all out here is the Steps for checking the status of the cancellation application –\n\n1.
