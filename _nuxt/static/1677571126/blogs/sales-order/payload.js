It serves as a formal record of the sales transaction, including the products or services ordered, the quantity, the agreed-upon price, and any other terms and conditions of the sale. A sales order is typically used to initiate the fulfillment process and to ensure that the customer's request is fulfilled accurately and on time.","A sales order typically comes before an invoice in a sales transaction.
