In its essence, it serves for a production process, what a recipe serves for a dish. It helps to identify the different raw materials and their quantities required in the process, like a recipe provides details of all the ingredients required for a finished dish. Thereby, a Bill of Material ensures that a production cycle can be completed without any issues."},{question:"Why do organizations need a Bill of Material software?",answer:"Organizations need a Bill of Material software to manage their production system efficiently. It helps them to manage raw materials, their quantity, and prices to make the manufacturing system smoother. A Bill of Material software for small businesses, can simplify several production processes, offer enhanced management oversight and reduce order delays."},{question:"What are the benefits of a Bill of Material software?",answer:"A Bill of Material software like TranZact can eliminate several manual processes and accelerate production. The benefits of a Bill of Material software are: 1. It helps in the easy identification and tracking of all raw materials required for production. 2. It helps in monitoring the history and upcoming changes in the initial production stages. 3. It tracks and shares real-time materials data, under each production process."}],toc:[{id:B,depth:r,text:C},{id:D,depth:l,text:A},{id:E,depth:l,text:F},{id:G,depth:l,text:H},{id:I,depth:l,text:J},{id:K,depth:l,text:L},{id:M,depth:r,text:N},{id:O,depth:r,text:P},{id:Q,depth:r,text:R},{id:S,depth:r,text:T},{id:U,depth:l,text:V},{id:W,depth:l,text:X},{id:Y,depth:l,text:Z},{id:_,depth:l,text:$},{id:aa,depth:l,text:ab},{id:ac,depth:l,text:ad},{id:ae,depth:r,text:af},{id:ag,depth:l,text:ah},{id:ai,depth:l,text:aj},{id:ak,depth:l,text:al},{id:am,depth:l,text:an},{id:ao,depth:l,text:ap},{id:aq,depth:l,text:ar},{id:as,depth:l,text:at}],body:{type:"root",children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The products in your manufacturing business require different raw materials.
