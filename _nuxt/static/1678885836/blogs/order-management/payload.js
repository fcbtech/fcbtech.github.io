Order management is the process of end-to-end order recording, execution and tracking of customer orders and ensuring they are delivered as agreed with the customer. While order fulfillment is a part of order management, the term may be used to describe the process of physically delivering the products to the customer, or in another context, it may refer to order assembling, shipping and customer support.","Order processing is the process of entering customer orders into the system and monitoring all the inventory and production functions required to convert them into finished products. The main purpose of an order processing system is to deploy the software to ensure all the equipment, resources, people, and materials are ready and available for quick, error-free order delivery.","what-is-order-management","what-is-an-order-management-system","What Is an Order Management System?","order-management-system-features","Order Management System Features","real-time-inventory-management","Real-time inventory management","automated-sales-processes","Automated sales processes","customer-relationship-management","Customer relationship management","centralized-order-management","Centralized order management","accounting-integration","Accounting integration","reporting","Reporting","flexibility","Flexibility","what-is-order-processing","What Is Order Processing?","importance-of-accurate-order-management","Importance of Accurate Order Management","time-utility","Time utility","improves-accuracy","Improves accuracy","enhances-customer-satisfaction","Enhances customer satisfaction","demand-forecasting","Demand forecasting","better-visibility","Better visibility","improves-efficiency-and-productivity","Improves efficiency and productivity","order-management-cycle","Order Management Cycle","phase-1--receiving-the-order","Phase 1 – Receiving the order","phase-2--fulfilling-the-order","Phase 2 – Fulfilling the order","phase-3--managing-inventory","Phase 3 – Managing inventory","phase-4--tracking-order","Phase 4 – Tracking order","phase-5--managing-post-sales","Phase 5 – Managing post sales","how-to-streamline-order-management-with-tranzact","How to Streamline Order Management With TranZact?","digitize-order-management-processes-with-the-right-oms","Digitize Order Management Processes With the Right OMS","faqs-on-order-management","FAQs on Order Management","\u002Fblogs\u002Forder-management","What Is a Purchase Requisition?","e_way_bill.png","E-Way Bill","How to Generate E-Invoice?","e_invoice_in_gst.png","What Is HSN Code?","What Is GSTR 3B?","What Is GSTR 1?","Documents Required for GST Registration","Advantages and Disadvantages of GST",11,0)));
