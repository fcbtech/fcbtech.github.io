An inventory management system is created to track the movement of stock in a particular warehouse, at any given period of time. On the other hand, a warehouse management system looks at the entire day-to-day management of a warehouse which includes everything from receiving the product, storing, picking it up, packing it, and shipping it, as well as managing the staff of the warehouse.","Stock is a term used to describe the products that are already available to a seller and are ready to be sold to customers. Inventory is a term that is more encompassing in that it describes all the available resources including the raw materials, the goods that are currently being manufactured as well as the goods ready to be sold.","what-is-warehouse-management","benefits-of-warehouse-management","Benefits of Warehouse Management","increased-efficiency","Increased efficiency","improved-productivity","Improved productivity","saved-costs","Saved costs","delighted-customers-and-partners","Delighted customers and partners","what-is-warehouse-management-system","What Is Warehouse Management System?","data-driven","Data-driven","increased-integration","Increased integration","enhanced-efficiency","Enhanced efficiency","key-features-of-warehouse-management-system","Key Features of Warehouse Management System","the-warehouse-design","The warehouse design","tracking-the-inventory","Tracking the inventory","human-resource-performance-tracking","Human resource performance tracking","quality-control","Quality control","management-of-the-dock","Management of the dock","data-insights-and-reporting","Data, insights, and reporting","inventory-management-vs-warehouse-management","Inventory Management Vs Warehouse Management","principles-of-warehouse-management","Principles of Warehouse Management","have-clear-objectives","Have clear objectives","data-driven-decision-making","Data-driven decision making","control-over-complexity","Control over complexity","customer-satisfaction-reigns-supreme","Customer satisfaction reigns supreme","mobile-and-agile","Mobile and agile","warehouse-management-process","Warehouse Management Process","step-1-receiving-the-products","Step 1: Receiving the products","step-2-the-put-away","Step 2: The put-away","step-3-the-storage-system","Step 3: The storage system","step-4-the-pick-up","Step 4: The pick-up","step-5-the-packaging-protocol","Step 5: The packaging protocol","step-6-shipping-it-off","Step 6: Shipping it off","warehouse-management-fulfillment-strategies","Warehouse Management Fulfillment Strategies","first-in-first-out","First in first out","first-expired-first-out","First expired first out","batch-processing","Batch processing","zone-picking","Zone picking","warehouse-monitoring-and-reporting","Warehouse Monitoring and Reporting","the-lead-time-of-an-order","The lead time of an order","product-return-rate","Product return rate","accuracy-of-order-picking","Accuracy of order picking","order-receiving-efficiency-rate","Order receiving efficiency rate","challenges-in-warehouse-management","Challenges in Warehouse Management","the-warehouse-layout","The warehouse layout","inaccurate-inventory-planning","Inaccurate inventory planning","volatile-labor-costs","Volatile labor costs","how-to-choose-warehouse-management-system","How to Choose Warehouse Management System?","return-on-investment","Return on investment","real-time-data","Real-time data","sophisticated-analytics-and-reporting","Sophisticated analytics and reporting","scalability-of-the-system","Scalability of the system","enable-optimization-of-warehouse-management-with-tranzact","Enable Optimization of Warehouse Management With TranZact","faqs-on-warehouse-management","FAQs on Warehouse Management","\u002Fblogs\u002Fwhat-is-warehouse-management-ultimate-guide-for-smes","Manufacturing Execution System",13,"Procurement","production_planning_and_control.png","Material Requirements Planning (MRP)","Best Production Planning Software",0)));
