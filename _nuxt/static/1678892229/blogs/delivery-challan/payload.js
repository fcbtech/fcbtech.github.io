The EBN will then be listed on the delivery challan, and the transporter can use this EBN to follow the progress of the goods using it.","The invoice serves as the official record of the transfer of ownership of the products or services, together with all the associated risks and liabilities; it also documents the true market value of the commodities. The delivery challan only demonstrates that the consumer has acknowledged receiving the items; it does not demonstrate their legal obligations or ownership.","A delivery note is only a piece of paper that comes with a package of goods.
