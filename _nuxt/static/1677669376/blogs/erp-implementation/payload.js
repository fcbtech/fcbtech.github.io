Planning: Collating requirements across functions to understand business needs. 2. Design: Understanding the workflows in place to tailor the new software accordingly and organizing data migration. 3. Development: Configuring the new system to meet business needs with relevant information for each functional area. 4. Testing: Fine-tuning, readjusting and repeatedly testing the system to see if problems emerge, and solving for them. 5. Deployment: Go live! The ERP system is now implemented at this stage. 6. Support: Keep an eye out for feedback and fixes, and provide continued support."},{question:"How can I avoid ERP implementation delays?",answer:"You can avoid ERP implementation delays by setting a realistic timeline after accurate research. When you are going for a total changeover of workflow, allow it to take a more thorough, detailed approach than the faster, cheaper one. ERP implementation teams need to be made up of the right resources and executives who are empowered to take quick decisions, and practice open communication."},{question:"Why does ERP implementation fail?",answer:"If you do not have a firm testing plan in place and don’t pay special attention to customizations, your ERP implementation may fail. Test by module and test rigorously. Do not overlook the planning stages, understand the objective behind this overhaul and have a clear vision. Another thing that often gets overlooked in ERP implementation is the post deployment training and support. Allocate adequate budgets and invest in solid training resources."},{question:"Cloud ERP vs On-premise ERP: what is the difference?",answer:"Cloud ERP is hosted on servers and accessed through a web browser. Cloud ERPs are a great solution for small and midsize businesses as they have lower upfront costs, on a subscription basis. They can be accessed from anywhere, at any time and also offer simplified and cost-effective training. On-premise ERP implementation approach is one where the new system is installed locally on a company’s own computers and servers. Contrary to periodical payments for Cloud ERP systems, an ERP implementation strategy with on-premise approach comes with an expensive, one-time cost, and high post implementation support and training effort."},{question:"Which is the most difficult phase in an ERP implementation?",answer:x},{question:"When should you implement ERP software?",answer:y}],toc:[{id:z,depth:l,text:A},{id:B,depth:m,text:C},{id:D,depth:l,text:E},{id:F,depth:l,text:G},{id:H,depth:l,text:I},{id:J,depth:l,text:K},{id:L,depth:l,text:M},{id:N,depth:l,text:O},{id:P,depth:m,text:Q},{id:R,depth:m,text:S},{id:T,depth:m,text:U},{id:V,depth:m,text:W},{id:X,depth:l,text:Y},{id:Z,depth:m,text:_},{id:$,depth:m,text:aa},{id:ab,depth:m,text:ac},{id:ad,depth:l,text:ae},{id:af,depth:m,text:ag},{id:ah,depth:m,text:ai},{id:aj,depth:m,text:ak},{id:al,depth:l,text:am},{id:an,depth:l,text:ao}],body:{type:"root",children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Before we jump into what ERP implementation means, we need to start by understanding what an "},{type:b,tag:s,props:{to:"\u002Fblogs\u002Ferp-software"},children:[{type:a,value:"ERP system"}]},{type:a,value:" actually is.
